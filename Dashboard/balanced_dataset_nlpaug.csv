"Why’s it worrying? I know it’s Liverpool or Villa because they both qualified for the CL and Arsenal were fighting City for the title. But I only know that because of context. I’m a Cardiff fan, the Premier League hasn’t been relevant to my season for several years now. 

I’m not really fussed about getting knocked out of either cup because I know we have no chance of winning them. Which is sad because we were FA Cup finalists in 2008 and League Cup finalists in 2012. But that’s the nature of modern football unfortunately. 

More teams have finished 4th in the last decade than won the League Cup. If Forest manage it they’ll be the 8th team in 11 years to do so. 

Villa won 20/38 games to finish 4th last season.

"I am a big ugly white guy from Richmond Virginia, the Capital of the Confederacy. One of the fun things about being a big white guy, the conservatives automatically assume you're one of them and they just say the darnedest things in front of you. Also, I'm a liberal with a bunch of conservative buddies. Let me tell you, they're PISSED about the statues being removed from Monument Avenue. Since I moved here in the 90's they're still vocally fighting the Civil War. 

When I was in high school, they still had Lee Jackson King Day. All the Mosely boys would muster in the Food Lion parking lot. They'd drive over to the high school in a convoy and stop in the parking lot bottle neck and play Dixie on a loud speaker and fly the Confederate flags high. Then our vice principal would pull them into the office and they'd whine about ""my free speech"" and ""it's my heritage, not hate"" and as soon as they thought nobody was listening they'd call her the n-word. They used to drive around off school property with little nooses hanging from their rear view mirrors. Fucking cowards. 

I'm still friends with a lot of these guys on Facebook. And yes they still regurgitate all the same racist bullshit that they used to. They haven't changed. They're deeply entrenched in their beliefs that their ancestors were somehow victims. And they are continuing to fight the fight. And they are continuing to fight the fight I know for a fact that a lot of them see Donald Trump and Project 2025 as the South rising again.

"Answer: The „4D chess move“ is probably simply the mar-a-lago accord. This is a tremendous gamble on the back of the whole world, especially the people already struggling, let alone the American people.

Check out this (clean archive.ph link) interesting article by Heike Buchta in the Germany paper „Zeit“. You’d need to translate it into English though.

The articles premise is that Trump wants some kind of global economic reordering, by use of the so called mar-a-lago accord. The reason, besides the long term plan with the crazy 100 year bonds, is to make the US dollar weak to be able to refinance the crushing deficit the US is facing, at lower interest rates.

I know, the quote says something along the lines of never attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity or some such, but if you read through the Zeit article, nearly every insane thing Don does - e.g. Greenland, Canada, Panama Canal, Ukraine, NATO - makes sense (note that I don’t think this plan or how it is being executed is good or even reasonable in any way… on the contrary).",No Slang,answer chess move probably simply maralago accord tremendous gamble back whole world especially people already struggling let alone american people check clean archiveph link interesting article heike buchta germany paper zeit youd need translate english though article premise trump want kind global economic reordering use called maralago accord reason besides long term plan crazy year bond make u dollar weak able refinance crushing deficit u facing lower interest rate know quote say something along line never attribute malice attributed stupidity read zeit article nearly every insane thing eg greenland canada panama canal ukraine nato make sense note dont think plan executed good even reasonable way contrary,3

"I'm glad you pointed this out. A lot of complaints on the game industry I see thrown at 'developers'. From microtransactions to delays to releases before being done. All those decisions are from way up in management and the publisher, not the lowly artists and developers doing the coding, modeling, testing.

Even more developer-adjacent complains like 'games are poorly optimized today and just require more powerful GPUs because developers are lazy now'. Again, its not so much developers are less skilled or lazy, its that games are more and more complex and publishers are pushing better graphics, ray tracing, more effects, bigger worlds, etc. and there's only so much resources and time to do it. The developers aren't making these decisions and if they are pushed to make it bigger, shinier, out the door faster, these are going to supercede optimized. It doesnt help that hardware these days makes less optimized graphics engines even possible, in the NES to PS2 era software techniques were generally ahead of software and it was possible to squeeze performance out of limited memory and raster, now with frame gen, upscaling, 24GB+ vram, fast SSDs, 300W cards, etc. possible, and the AAA sequel expected next year,  its like why even bother with some of the genius steps devs took in 90s and early 2000s to make magic happen with potato hardware, cartridges, physical discs, platter drives, minimal ram, slow clock speeds.",No Slang,im glad pointed lot complaint game industry see thrown developer microtransactions delay release done decision way management publisher lowly artist developer coding modeling testing even developeradjacent complains like game poorly optimized today require powerful gpus developer lazy much developer less skilled lazy game complex publisher pushing better graphic ray tracing effect bigger world etc there much resource time developer arent making decision pushed make bigger shinier door faster going supercede optimized doesnt help hardware day make less optimized graphic engine even possible ne p era software technique generally ahead software possible squeeze performance limited memory raster frame gen upscaling gb vram fast ssds w card etc possible aaa sequel expected next year like even bother genius step devs took early make magic happen potato hardware cartridge physical disc platter drive minimal ram slow clock speed,3

But I mean the player always has an opinion on this too and obviously players always want to play. Kim clearly felt like he could play so he played. Over the past couple weeks or so Minjae had I think 2 instances where he didn’t start a game and Eric Dier came in (and played well too) but then Upamecano got hurt so Minjae stepped in again. 

I think at first Kompany was hesitant to play Dier because he’s definitely lacking the pace of Kim and Upa but Dier is so good with his positioning and ball playing that he’s figured out how to mitigate his lack of pace issues. So yeah, Dier has started to play a bit more recently as the 3rd option to rotate either of Kim and Upa but this only recently started happening. 

Ultimately tho Kim has decided to keep playing. He got “rest” from practice time to time and I’m sure the medical staff was monitoring him closely. While I understand the frustration of Korea, I just think it really came down to Kim wanting to push through.

"We frequently interact with correctional officers in our hospital. I've had far more problems with the COs than prisoners as patients.

There are decent ones, but you'll also find the job attracts many of a certain personality. It constantly amazes me the kind of juvenile, sophomoric, and outright cruel behaviors I've seen with many of them.

Some just sit and eat all day, ordering ""courtesy trays"" from the kitchen all shift and watch movies, then act like you're really inconveniencing them or outright refuse when you try to work with the patient.

I had two playing a game of paper football purposely over a patient's head, leading to the football being constantly flicked into the patient's face. I asked for their names to report, but they laughed and said their supervisor *taught* them this little game.

I went to go to the bathroom to find a CO standing outside it around their shift change. He offered to let me go ahead of him. Another CO the exited the bathroom with a big grin on his face that turned to horror when he saw me standing there. He'd pissed all over the toilet seat and floor as a prank to the next officer.

I've had many that will laugh and make fun of stroke patients with aphasia or dysarthria when they try to talk, some to the point that the patient will stop trying to speak altogether. Similarly, those that make fun of ""funny walks.""

I had to call my Mum in the middle of the night and ask her to cancel my credit cards etc. Luckily, my brother had my passport and hadn’t been robbed. 

A day later I show up at London Heathrow - with only a photocopy of my flight ticket. Technically the Air Canada agent shouldn’t have allowed me to check in using a photocopy - there was a chance that Air Canada wouldn’t be able to collect the money from the travel agency I’d paid, without the original copy. 

I burst into tears at the counter, sick from too many sleepless nights, just wanting to go home. Bless that woman, she let me on the plane after telling me she’d been in a similar situation when she was young and backpacking.

"Good buddy, if all you know of sex is from porn, here are a couple of important things worth keeping in mind:

1. It’s not really all that much like porn. The positions they do in porn aren’t actually all that much fun most of the time, unless you’re putting on a show for someone (a la porn actors putting on a show for the camera). 

2. You should stop watching porn a couple months before your wedding night, maybe even from here going forward. You might find that your ol fella won’t rise to the occasion.

Also, be ready for the possibility that you or your wife might not be super into it *on* the actual wedding night. Keep in mind, both you and she have been avoiding and repressing your sexual desires *your entire life*… it might not be just a switch you can flick - especially for women. She might instinctively flinch, you might flinch - there’s areas on your body that might be ticklish, you’ve never been touched there by someone else and you won’t know until it happens. The headline is, don’t necessarily expect or build up the wedding night to be all fireworks and orgasms. You might find that it absolutely is that, which would be great of course, but it also might be awkward and uncomfortable and it might take a few goes before you get the real fireworks happening.

Oh lastly, if you have any intention of doing oral, shower like right beforehand.. give your penis *and* ass a thorough wash. You don’t think the ass is involved? It might not be but it’s right next door. With any luck someone will give the wife this same advice about washing. 

Anyway, this sounds all bad…. I dunno maybe I’m just telling you all the stuff I wish I’d been told before my first time. It’s really great though. You’re in for a treat. I can’t really describe what it’s like anymore than you could describe the taste of water to someone dying of thirst. I think you’ll like it a lot.",No Slang,good buddy know sex porn couple important thing worth keeping mind really much like porn position porn arent actually much fun time unless youre putting show someone la porn actor putting show camera stop watching porn couple month wedding night maybe even going forward might find ol fella wont rise occasion also ready possibility wife might super actual wedding night keep mind avoiding repressing sexual desire entire life might switch flick especially woman might instinctively flinch might flinch there area body might ticklish youve never touched someone else wont know happens headline dont necessarily expect build wedding night firework orgasm might find absolutely would great course also might awkward uncomfortable might take go get real firework happening oh lastly intention oral shower like right beforehand give penis as thorough wash dont think as involved might right next door luck someone give wife advice washing anyway sound bad dunno maybe im telling stuff wish id told first time really great though youre treat cant really describe like anymore could describe taste water someone dying thirst think youll like lot,3

">USA alienated itself from the rest of the world, again. Showed they would rather let Russia conquer and sell the spoils than help defend democracy and freedom. Any goodwill America had is essentially gone now.

I dont think people fully grasp what this means. Ever since the end of WW2, so roughly 80 years, the United States has been the unquestioned leader of the Western World. Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, roughly 40 years, the United States has been the unquestioned leader of the entire World. That has changed today.

Every time the US pushes for favorable trade conditions with any part of the world, the rest of the western world pushes alongside for those conditions. Every western nation purchases goods but especially sophisticated weaponry and looks to the United States to set standards for their military. Most of these nations either have little or no domestic military industry, meaning they spend all of that money with US based companies or through licensing agreements. That has changed today.

By publicly throwing an ally under the bus the rest of the world has been very publicly shown they cannot ever rely on the US to cultivate shared interests and when once a joint and standardized military arrangement like NATO was seen as an incredible strength, it is now an incredible liability.

This will have negative ripple effects for the US for generations.",No Slang,usa alienated rest world showed would rather let russia conquer sell spoil help defend democracy freedom goodwill america essentially gone dont think people fully grasp mean ever since end ww roughly year united state unquestioned leader western world ever since fall soviet union roughly year united state unquestioned leader entire world changed today every time u push favorable trade condition part world rest western world push alongside condition every western nation purchase good especially sophisticated weaponry look united state set standard military nation either little domestic military industry meaning spend money u based company licensing agreement changed today publicly throwing ally bus rest world publicly shown ever rely u cultivate shared interest joint standardized military arrangement like nato seen incredible strength incredible liability negative ripple effect u generation,3

They’re doing EXACTLY what H did in Germany the 1930’s. I wish more people knew history.

Anything that was a 'detriment' to building up a military again from scratch to invade their neighbors, was cut as wasteful spending.
It wasn't until ten years later that the Holocaust was in full swing.

"It’s like clockwork, just before I go to bed. My hands and feet become incredibly dry. I can almost see the skin stretching due to the dryness. The texture becomes similar to paper. Every night before bed, I apply lotion to both my hands and feet. During the day, there’s no issue, and I only need to add more lotion if I feel dry- it’s not too often. However, I don’t understand why this has been happening for years and how it gets so incredibly dry.

I asked my partner if he’s experienced anything similar or if he’s aware of this issue. He’s never heard of anything like it and hardly ever needs to use lotion himself. Not that we men the epitome of skincare routines, but I’m at a loss for what’s causing this.  I drink anywhere between 50 to 80 ounces of water a day as a guy, it’s not good but it keeps my urine at an almost clear color. And I try to do more where I can. But even then that has not changed the predictability of the dry skin at night. 

I am taking one medication, and that sort of side effect is not something that has ever been even remotely documented associated with that prescription. And I will also be getting off of that prescription here soon.

Saudi is already at a somewhat of a saturation point with almost all teams having fille their foreign player slots, meaning they now have to sell before buying (and their players might be hard to move given inflated wages).

All this also assumes that Salah will accept going to Saudi, and even if he is willing to go, unless the fee is sizeable, there is likely no benefit for him being contracted for longer rather than just renegotiating 

Making a very risky financial decision based on trusting someone will be there to bail you out is not a good way to run a football club. Especially when the world is entering a turbulent economic environment.",No Slang,anything year deal actually protects value line completely wrong youre specifying offering longer deal exchange lower wage demand downside washed player k per week much higher maybe negotiate year saudi already somewhat saturation point almost team fille foreign player slot meaning sell buying player might hard move given inflated wage also assumes salah accept going saudi even willing go unless fee sizeable likely benefit contracted longer rather renegotiating making risky financial decision based trusting someone bail good way run football club especially world entering turbulent economic environment,3

"His results were perfectly what we expect. If there are no visible shapes to be seen, the camera can't see them. LIDAR and RADAR are far better for self driving. We humans can interpret our surroundings and map them to a 3D ""map"" of where things are in relation with each other. Even before we get to object recognition part, we don't need to really identify object to know how far it is. Having a constant real time 3D map is FAR easier data for computers to handle, the most important part of the process is done by the imaging device itself: gauge distances. We don't need to know what it is to be able to make decisions.

Image recognition is ass backwards: utilize sophisticated algorithms that require a lot of processing power and are almost impossible to make fool proof to achieve something that a LIDAR/RADAR can do without ANY processing: we simply list all the points in XYZ space and check where they are in relation to our trajectory. We can do further processing but it is very simple and fast, points close together in 3D space are most likely part of the same object.. It is all just pure logic, it is not complicated at all. The entire problem with them resides in the hardware that is used for sensing.

So, they are not using the expensive hardware but instead try to do it the hard way that is guaranteed to fail more just to save some money but from engineering standpoint it is INSANE idea. Even if the end goal is image recognition alone, it should be trained with LIDAR in place for a LOOOOONG time because of safety. Tesla is beta and alpha testing with end consumers on the public roads. Everything they do is ass backwards from safety and engineering point of view but absolutely logical if saving and making money is #1.

I wouldn't be surprised if they still don't.

"I've had a few surgeries and finally learned with the last one, that waking up crying and making weird animalistic groans is the norm for me. So normal, I'm going to make sure to tell the team it happens next time lol. I think it comes from my anxiety fighting the sleep to begin with. Like everyone else said, it goes so fast but is the deepest rest I've ever felt in my life. The confusion of suddenly being awake

With my impacted wisdom teeth, I was 18 and I woke up crying so bad they had to have my mom come back early and they were so mean about it. 

Emergency surgery due to a ruptured ectopic and internal bleeding is the only one I don't fully remember waking up from. But I do remember a nurse holding my hand in the OR before. I was in so much pain... he was such a rock for me. I was ready to be knocked out for that one. Did not care. Came to terms with the fact that I might die. 

With my gallbladder, I remember coming out of it upset and hearing someone say ""go get her doctor so she recognizes someone."" And the doctor came and stroked my hand and explained it went well. My response? ""You're so young!"" Lmao meanwhile the guy next to me is asking when he can eat. So chill.

Then it happened again in 2023 for another abdominal surgery. I remember hearing the nurse bring my husband in and tell him something like ""she just started calming down."" And I started groaning and crying again and he had a giggle. He said the noises were... interesting hahah.

So yeah, that's my norm. Any other criers here?

"> in general I do feel like people hold self driving cars to a way higher standard than they should


If you are trusting the computer to drive your car, it should be held to a high standard.


Real driving has problems and difficulties beyond what an exaggerated cruise control can handle.


Lets say we stick the current gen of self-driving cars out on the road as self-driving, no human with a license needed. Now what happens when it rains? When it snows? Suddenly everything on the road is visually obscured. Road lines aren't clear anymore, GPS may be interrupted and spotty.


What do you propose the result will be? If the cars just decide not to drive, suddenly everyone in the city is stranded with a car wherever they happen to be. There's not enough taxis and tow trucks for everyone to get home when their cars decide not to drive. Practically speaking, the only acceptable solution drivers would accept would be the cars attempt to drive in inclement weather regardless. And predictably, if they do a bad job of it, it's going to cause a lot of crashes and accidents.


Like, self-driving can't target just working 80% of the time, people need their cars all of the time, even during emergencies. The self-driving has to be good enough to handle the worst situations.",No Slang,general feel like people hold self driving car way higher standard trusting computer drive car held high standard real driving problem difficulty beyond exaggerated cruise control handle let say stick current gen selfdriving car road selfdriving human license needed happens rain snow suddenly everything road visually obscured road line arent clear anymore gps may interrupted spotty propose result car decide drive suddenly everyone city stranded car wherever happen there enough taxi tow truck everyone get home car decide drive practically speaking acceptable solution driver would accept would car attempt drive inclement weather regardless predictably bad job going cause lot crash accident like selfdriving cant target working time people need car time even emergency selfdriving good enough handle worst situation,3

"What? No, of course not. I would like the government to pay for healthcare so we’re not forced to buy insurance from private companies.

And I think most people are unaware of what each insurance company’s take is. If we can’t have government healthcare, then I would like it to be really easy to compare each company’s takes, so we buy insurance from the companies that pay out the most and so insurance companies compete to keep that margin thin.

But more importantly, why are the bills so high in the first place? A 17% reduction in healthcare costs won’t get us anywhere near the costs people pay in Korea even when they don’t have insurance.

"Some legal points as someone studying environmental management, National Monuments are not mini national parks, though they are also controlled by the parks service (who care for more than just national parks). National Monuments are supposed to be ‘the smallest area necessary for their purpose’ this is unique to nat monuments. Trump is reducing their size using that framework. Presidents create national monuments via executive order so presidents can also reduce their size or get rid of them. National Parks are created by acts of congress and therefore need an act of congress to get rid of them. All of this to say though, our parks are incredibly vulnerable. Even more so our national forests as they are multiple use and can be essentially pillaged for profitable resources. 

We have fought so hard for sustainable management and we have so much more work to do, but a privileged few seem to have decided they’d rather rape the land for nothing but greed and immediate personal financial gain than try to usher in a better future. We need to fight for these wildlands. They will disappear faster than can be comprehended if we don’t and we will never see them again. Why can they do all of this?

"Answer: Public schools are primarily funded through property taxes. It is an inherently unequal system which gives much more funding to schools in high value districts than in poor. 

However, public schooling does allow for an ""equal"" opportunity for education, no matter the socioeconomic class of the parent. If the DOE funding ended tomorrow, those property taxes funding the public schools, in theory, would disappear. This would NOT benefit renters, or trailer owners. This would minimally benefit poor land owners. But this would greatly benefit wealthy land owners and landlords, as their children are the least likely to be attending public school in the first place... 

So, now the poor will HAVE to pay for their children's education, regardless of if they own land or can afford it, and wealthy landowners will no longer subsidize public education - which they HEAVILY rely on for the education of the skilled and unskilled labor they used to grow their wealth. 

It is just another example of passing the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class (yet again) and calling it ""freedom"" or something....",No Slang,answer public school primarily funded property tax inherently unequal system give much funding school high value district poor however public schooling allow equal opportunity education matter socioeconomic class parent doe funding ended tomorrow property tax funding public school theory would disappear would benefit renter trailer owner would minimally benefit poor land owner would greatly benefit wealthy land owner landlord child least likely attending public school first place poor pay childrens education regardless land afford wealthy landowner longer subsidize public education heavily rely education skilled unskilled labor used grow wealth another example passing tax burden wealthy poor middle class yet calling freedom something,3

"it’s like when someone says they got x iphone pro so they can play genshin at a slightly higher frame rate and they say they’re a hardcore gamer the same as you are on the top of your pc pile. it’s like the top of a tiny mole hill when there’s a bigger hill right next to it called console gaming and then the bigger hill next to that called pc gaming. it’s one of the difficulties in using a generic term like “hardcore gamer” because it doesn’t necessarily mean the same thing to everyone. 

don’t get me wrong, i’m just trying to explain what they are probably imagining and it’s not really incorrect as far as performance/customization goes. consoles are undeniably more accessible and standardized than pcs which have significantly higher top end. this is neither good nor bad, but if someone labels hardcore as wanting the highest performance from your potential machines vs passion and investment they are going to see everything but the top half of the pc pile differently. 

also and this isn’t a critique of you, but i think it hurt your argument focusing on the console type and nice tv factor instead of the 30 years of gaming. like if instead of “i bought a nice af tv so i am gamer” you said “i beat x game 100%” or “i have x hours on x game” or “i play fighting games competitively” then it’d be less easy to read as “oh i invested a lot of money so im hardcore” and more “im hardcore so i invested”. hope that makes sense.",No Slang,like someone say got x iphone pro play genshin slightly higher frame rate say theyre hardcore gamer top pc pile like top tiny mole hill there bigger hill right next called console gaming bigger hill next called pc gaming one difficulty using generic term like hardcore gamer doesnt necessarily mean thing everyone dont get wrong im trying explain probably imagining really incorrect far performancecustomization go console undeniably accessible standardized pc significantly higher top end neither good bad someone label hardcore wanting highest performance potential machine v passion investment going see everything top half pc pile differently also isnt critique think hurt argument focusing console type nice tv factor instead year gaming like instead bought nice af tv gamer said beat x game x hour x game play fighting game competitively itd less easy read oh invested lot money im hardcore im hardcore invested hope make sense,3

"I was a regular church goer for most of my life, as was my wife.  Kids baptized, active in choir, taught bible study, volunteer efforts, the works.

When my wife was diagnosed with metastatic cancer her treatments became very rough and her health deteriorated rapidly.  This was pre-Obamacare days and she wasn’t covered under my employers insurance plan due to pre-existing condition clauses.  We had been tithing regularly and were giving extra towards the churches new building fund.  We had to stop that to make ends meet but still tithed what we could.  The senior pastor contacted us and asked why and I told him and he asked if he and the deacons could do a special prayer session for her health.  

We showed up to the session, laying on of hands and whole process.  It was emotionally nurturing but her health continued to spiral.  Each visit we got more and more bad news.  Finally, a diagnosis of Stage 4 and she was given only months to live.  We were once again approached by our pastor who asked to come to our home and see us.

During that visit the godless bastard looked straight at her and said she must have some “hidden sin” that was preventing her from being healed and this was Gods way of pushing her to seek the better path blah blah blah.

My wife was sitting there, oxygen tubes up her nose, no hair, down 60lbs from her vibrant pre-cancer self and could barely speak above a whisper.  And he had the gall to accuse her of committing some hidden “sin” stopping God from granting her healing.

I threw him out of our home.  I refuse to worship any God that needs to play with their creation to somehow get off on praise.  That’s bullshit.

She died one of the most wholesome women I’ve ever known and several years later I’d learn that pastor was diddling several kids in the congregation.

If God exists it’s not in any church.  Church was designed to glorify evil men.

**EDIT**

This blew up overnight.  For some follow-up to common questions I’m seeing in the replies to my post….

First, thank you for your support, understanding and even pointing out that one bad pastor (and this man was truly vile) doesn’t condemn an entire religion.  You are right, it doesn’t and shouldn’t.  But I’ve since encountered this in so many other religious settings.  I know the Bible well enough to know there’s literally the opposite support for this belief that “you are being punished for some secret sin.”  Bad people often flourish in this world.  Good people often suffer.  I don’t understand that, other than to understand that good or bad, suffering is the human condition and all faith can offer (often with great effect) is a means to endure it.  

I have been in a few churches since that one, and each of them I felt more and more convinced that its the man/woman behind the pulpit and their character that defines that church.  Which means it’s more of a congregation of charisma and influence than any meaningful expression of worship of God.  Thus….I no longer go to church.  It’s a flawed institution and I’ve found no need to attend any church to maintain a spiritual outlook.  I still ‘tithe’ but now it’s donations to charitable orgs that I research carefully and have a proven track record of actually helping others….and either via coincidence or design, NONE of those orgs are affiliated with any particular religious institution.   

And for those asking.  Not Mormon.  Not Catholic.  Not SDA.  Straight up non-denominational christian church.  One of the larger ones in the region, responsible for spinning off many other versions of the same mega-church.  The pastor disappeared for several years after the incident but later re-appeared at another church.  I don’t blame God for allowing that pastor to continue to live and prosper.  I blame the Church for allowing that….even more proof to me that the institution of Church is the problem.",Offensive Slang,regular church goer life wife kid baptized active choir taught bible study volunteer effort work wife diagnosed metastatic cancer treatment became rough health deteriorated rapidly preobamacare day wasnt covered employer insurance plan due preexisting condition clause tithing regularly giving extra towards church new building fund stop make end meet still tithed could senior pastor contacted u asked told asked deacon could special prayer session health showed session laying hand whole process emotionally nurturing health continued spiral visit got bad news finally diagnosis stage given month live approached pastor asked come home see u visit godless bastard looked straight said must hidden sin preventing healed god way pushing seek better path blah blah blah wife sitting oxygen tube nose hair lb vibrant precancer self could barely speak whisper gall accuse committing hidden sin stopping god granting healing threw home refuse worship god need play creation somehow get praise thats bullshit died one wholesome woman ive ever known several year later id learn pastor diddling several kid congregation god exists church church designed glorify evil men edit blew overnight followup common question im seeing reply post first thank support understanding even pointing one bad pastor man truly vile doesnt condemn entire religion right doesnt shouldnt ive since encountered many religious setting know bible well enough know there literally opposite support belief punished secret sin bad people often flourish world good people often suffer dont understand understand good bad suffering human condition faith offer often great effect mean endure church since one felt convinced manwoman behind pulpit character defines church mean congregation charisma influence meaningful expression worship god thusi longer go church flawed institution ive found need attend church maintain spiritual outlook still tithe donation charitable orgs research carefully proven track record actually helping othersand either via coincidence design none orgs affiliated particular religious institution asking mormon catholic sda straight nondenominational christian church one larger one region responsible spinning many version megachurch pastor disappeared several year incident later reappeared another church dont blame god allowing pastor continue live prosper blame church allowing thateven proof institution church problem,2

"Answer: It is controversial bc its not well understood and the waters are being muddied by peoples emotional feelings towards Trump/Palestine/Israel. Many people who are upset about this view it as an infringement on freedom of speech and due process. Additionally, the way he was detained was unusual and caused some to believe this is a gestapo style detainment.

Mahmoud is a greencard holder which is a privilege not a right and like any other privilege it can be revoked with or without reason at any time prior to naturalization. A greencard holder does not have the same rights and protections as an American citizen. Committing crimes is the easiest way to lose this status. In the event the federal government decides to revoke green card status, it would be ICE who would be responsible for detaining the greencard holder and this would happen without a warrant or due process.

Contrary to popular belief, freedom of speech is not unlimited. It is a federal crime in the US to provide resources or support for any designated terrorist organization. In this case, HAMAS has been designated as a terrorist organization since 1997 and Mahmoud was on video chanting support for them and screaming ""death to America"".

Although the US is well within its rights to deny him due process, I do think Mahmoud will have his day in court. That being said, given the video evidence and the landscape in the US these days, I believe he will ultimately lose.",No Slang,answer controversial bc well understood water muddied people emotional feeling towards trumppalestineisrael many people upset view infringement freedom speech due process additionally way detained unusual caused believe gestapo style detainment mahmoud greencard holder privilege right like privilege revoked without reason time prior naturalization greencard holder right protection american citizen committing crime easiest way lose status event federal government decides revoke green card status would ice would responsible detaining greencard holder would happen without warrant due process contrary popular belief freedom speech unlimited federal crime u provide resource support designated terrorist organization case hamas designated terrorist organization since mahmoud video chanting support screaming death america although u well within right deny due process think mahmoud day court said given video evidence landscape u day believe ultimately lose,3

"Rome was constantly reinventing itself throughout its existence even into the Imperial era. You have the Principate which is Augustus through the Crisis of the Third Century. During this time there was one Emperor and one Emperor alone. To vastly over simplify as time wore on it became apparent that one man couldn't rule over all of that  territory alone, and after the Crisis of the Third Century Diocletian overhauled the system into the Tetrarchy, which split the empire into four administrative districts, increasing the # of emperors to four. The system as Diocletian envisioned it was very flawed (senior emperors were supposed to voluntarily retire, they weren't supposed to have blood successors) but when Constantine took over he kept the idea of a split empire, though paring it back to two. 

Corruption did certainly exist in Rome, and in the fifth century in the West, there was an unusually high amount of corruption that *combined with multiple exogenous shocks to the system* such as Atilla the Hun would eventually weaken the western empire enough that it would fall. But Rome's transition to empire was not the instant kiss of death Edward Gibbon would have you believe by any measure.",No Slang,rome constantly reinventing throughout existence even imperial era principate augustus crisis third century time one emperor one emperor alone vastly simplify time wore became apparent one man couldnt rule territory alone crisis third century diocletian overhauled system tetrarchy split empire four administrative district increasing emperor four system diocletian envisioned flawed senior emperor supposed voluntarily retire werent supposed blood successor constantine took kept idea split empire though paring back two corruption certainly exist rome fifth century west unusually high amount corruption combined multiple exogenous shock system atilla hun would eventually weaken western empire enough would fall rome transition empire instant kiss death edward gibbon would believe measure,3

"I've had like five men who haven't been family friends / family who have interacted with me not be awful to me since middle school started. ( Counting trans men it would be seven ) This includes a guy who said hi to me a few times and held the door open for me. So no, I don't have high standards. Pretty sure one of them had two girlfriends.  ( Nice to me not to thee. ) And one of those girlfriends was always shooting me dirty looks so maybe she at least thought he was trying to get with me. One I sit with awkwardly in class and he doesn't insult me and has said hi to me a few times so I count him. There are some more men but they said such awful things about our teachers I won't even add them to the count. 

I live in a blue state. 

Please don't blame me when I'm a little more unsure of men than women as my number for women past middle school being nicer would be much larger. My number for men hurting me vs women hurting me would be much larger as well. Maybe when I get past highschool this prejudice won't be as needed but school boys at least are majority awful from what I've seen, met, heard, realized. 

Group of boys in my middle would talk about gang b/nging the teachers women or man. Two/three harassed me. My p.e teacher assaulted me and the guys who harassed me called me a liar when I came out about it. Changed middle schools. The first day a guy came up to me, told me to look to my side, then grabbed my face and turned it towards him then walked away. 

I've been asked 'What color is it? is it pink?' 'Want to get with my friend?' ( I was having a breakdown about whether or not I want to go back into a mental hospital, didn't know those guys, they asked it will walking past, not the goddamn time. ) 'Hey my friend likes you!' yeah thanks I know that it should be considered an insult to have any feelings or care for me! 

'Yeah [ my name ] is my girlfriend.' I am not. Was not. Never will be. 'Hey what do you think about my friend?' 'Hes weird I don't know him and he keeps calling me his girlfriend.' I felt bad for being too harsh in front of everyone.  *the guy kept calling me his girlfriend after that so I guess not harsh enough though.* 

I don't think I have that heavy of a prejudice when I'm actually faced towards a guy in person, unfortunately.
 But please don't blame other girls/women for having one it would probably benefit me greatly if I did and girls/women don't owe men/boys compliance and to be gentle and polite and considerate when treated with the opposite behavior repeatedly. 

I've been whistled at in the halls or during p.e. Called a 'mommy' by a stranger.

But, if he really is trying to harm/change the status quo of national parks and has the power to, I’m curious as to why, since it seems to have bipartisan appreciation from both republicans and democrats, and is widely regarded as one of the best parts of America.

"Do you know how your rent has gone up, groceries have gone up, electric bill has gone up?

Well, those costs have gone up for food trucks too

Food trucks are also just another business ,they are not inherently ""cheap"". If anything, sometimes their costs can be just as much as a traditional restaurant in terms of food prep. They still have to meet all health codes. They have to meet minimum wage, and be competitive with the local market. And of course they need power, gas, some type of water access for hand washing, food, supplies, refigeration, etc...

$15 for 4 tacos is $3.75. That doesn't sound that bad when you consider costs. In the US you can easily spend that much on tacos, often more like $4-5 in a sit down restaurant. Plus at sit down, you have to tip.

Your 2-3 for $5 nearly a decade ago is almost irrelevant. You might as well start talking about how a movie and a talkie used to cost a nickel. 

I don't know if this is the first time you stepped outside in 5 years, but we had a worldwide pandemic a while back. You might have heard of it.

The American people will NEVER truly be a friendly support system for Russia or Putin.   They are just going to be able to go unchecked for a minute.  If they overstep, it will bring the american people into focus against russia.  Maybe the rest of the world will step up and actually do something against Russia.

Executive orders from the president mean very, very little.  They are not laws passed by congress.  They do not change our constitutional rights.  Their only real effect is within government agencies and the focus or operation of those agencies...   sure there could be some trickle down effects here or there, but at the end of the day it will not effect most Americans and it will be a temporary thing until the next president starts writing their executive orders.

"The frustration with them as non-Liverpool or Man United fans is that they clearly each know their own clubs in depth and behind the scenes, so can provide thoughtful analysis and opinion based on that. Then you have them commenting on Arsenal, Spurs, Chelsea etc and they revert to soundbites and lazy analysis. 

As fans of those clubs, we follow them obsessively. We live and breath information relating to our respective clubs.

"Dunno about you but I found the Star Citizen flight model woefully lacking compared to E:D. 

I played on a free play weekend and it was like a game that had ships modded into an FPS game rather than a bespoke space game.

Even Starfield had slightly more engaging flight models and there's bugger all to do with your spaceship.

And yeah that's kinda what I mean, I'm interested to see the new ships but they don't do anything my other 15+ don't do, and going through the engineering grind loop isn't fun enough to get me back.

Arguably the biggest issue with procedurally generated space games is there isn't enough to do, find and explore. 

I remember the early days of flying round looking for high signal strength spots and hoping they appear and then hoping it's the right encounter kind and then hoping they drop chemical manipulators not chemicals processors...

RNG drops aren't fun and engaging and grinding isn't a substitute for things to do.

That's where I want to see Frontier develop. They have hands down the best space simulator ever made with fantastic graphics, amazing ship handling and flawless sound design.

He's going to be 33 next season but he's coming off his most efficient season ever, and we're so reliant on him and will continue to rely on him due to the lack of attacking talent in world football that can produce close to his rate. He's never injured, looks after himself and has become a lot smarter with how he conserves energy throughout games.

Now the major reason I see no risk in this is that, even if he did fall off a cliff next year, he is the most attractive asset to Saudi Arabia outside of the absolute elite younger talents (Mbappe, Haaland, Vini). Next summer Saudi Arabia are 100% still willing to spend silly money on him even if he does have a down year, so theres little risk in paying him the money he likely wants.

"You’re exactly right. Trump is jealous of Zelenskyy because Zelenskyy is legitimately a lot of the things that Trump claims to want in leadership. He takes strong actions, works tirelessly for his people, and is very publicly patriotic, to the point of inspiring millions worldwide to a love for Ukraine. More than anything else, Zelenskyy puts his money where his mouth is – he’s a straight shooter who will make his goals clear, then refuse to do anything but work towards them. 

Trump, for all his bravado, doesn’t really know how to *do* anything. He’s pretty good at yelling until someone does something, but when it comes time for him to actually write the policies, he very frequently blunders. Probably seeing even some of his fanboys shake their heads over his public support of Putin over Zelenskyy really shook him, because Trump knows he’s impotent, and is deeply insecure about it. Zelenskyy is exactly the democratic strongman that Trump claims and tries to be – but because he sucks at actual charisma, he ends up more like Putin.",No Slang,youre exactly right trump jealous zelenskyy zelenskyy legitimately lot thing trump claim want leadership take strong action work tirelessly people publicly patriotic point inspiring million worldwide love ukraine anything else zelenskyy put money mouth he straight shooter make goal clear refuse anything work towards trump bravado doesnt really know anything he pretty good yelling someone something come time actually write policy frequently blunder probably seeing even fanboys shake head public support putin zelenskyy really shook trump know he impotent deeply insecure zelenskyy exactly democratic strongman trump claim try suck actual charisma end like putin,3

"Oh, you’re looking forward to me not responding? Cute. But since you went through all this effort, I’d hate to disappoint you.


1. Trump’s ‘fascism’—Define it.
Claiming news organizations are “illegal” is obviously political rhetoric, not a legal action. If rhetoric equals fascism, then let’s talk about actual government-backed censorship through social media collusion, DHS ‘disinfo’ boards, and direct suppression of dissent under previous administrations. You asked for examples? Look up the Twitter Files, the Missouri v. Biden case, and how the government leaned on tech companies to silence viewpoints they disliked.

2. Mass censorship—Do you really want to go there?
You’re pretending that speech suppression is a one-sided issue, but the overwhelming evidence shows that mass deplatforming, corporate-government coordination, and ‘disinformation’ crackdowns always lean one way. If Trump did this at the same scale, you’d be screaming about dictatorship.

3. Political prosecutions—You need me to spell it out?
Selective prosecution, double standards in the justice system, and the use of lawfare to silence opposition are textbook authoritarian tactics. Biden’s DOJ has done more to weaponize the courts against political enemies than anything you’re alleging Trump did. Meanwhile, Trump’s actual supporters were surveilled, censored, and labeled as extremists for daring to exist.

4. Forcing ideological loyalty—Yes, DEI is a cult.
Nice baiting attempt. No one is arguing against equal opportunity—what’s being called out is the demand for ideological conformity, where anyone questioning the dogma of “equity” is punished. The government forcing schools and corporations to adopt ideological frameworks under the guise of ‘inclusion’ is the definition of compelled speech. Scrubbing DEI initiatives that actively push racial and ideological discrimination isn’t ‘erasing equality,’ it’s removing state-enforced propaganda.


Now, since you’re keeping score, I’ll be looking forward to you moving the goalposts again.",No Slang,oh youre looking forward responding cute since went effort id hate disappoint trump fascismdefine claiming news organization illegal obviously political rhetoric legal action rhetoric equal fascism let talk actual governmentbacked censorship social medium collusion dhs disinfo board direct suppression dissent previous administration asked example look twitter file missouri v biden case government leaned tech company silence viewpoint disliked mass censorshipdo really want go youre pretending speech suppression onesided issue overwhelming evidence show mass deplatforming corporategovernment coordination disinformation crackdown always lean one way trump scale youd screaming dictatorship political prosecutionsyou need spell selective prosecution double standard justice system use lawfare silence opposition textbook authoritarian tactic bidens doj done weaponize court political enemy anything youre alleging trump meanwhile trump actual supporter surveilled censored labeled extremist daring exist forcing ideological loyaltyyes dei cult nice baiting attempt one arguing equal opportunitywhats called demand ideological conformity anyone questioning dogma equity punished government forcing school corporation adopt ideological framework guise inclusion definition compelled speech scrubbing dei initiative actively push racial ideological discrimination isnt erasing equality removing stateenforced propaganda since youre keeping score ill looking forward moving goalpost,3

"It's even a little more subtle than that.

Anaesthesia is a trifecta. You remove awareness, pain, and movement.

Propofol can remove awareness, but your nerve endings (and ultimately, your central nervous system) can still register pain, even if you're not consciously aware of it. Pain is a dynamic response, and left untreated, it can grow, independant of your conscious awareness.

So in addition to propofol, you will generally be given an opioid, and a local anaesthetic, to deal with pain during the intra, and peri-operative period. Even though you're not consciously aware of the pain that's being inflicted on your body, the pain is treated while you're under the effect of propofol/sevoflurane/etc, to minimize the ""residual"" pain you experience when you wake. The pain pathways (which have pathways independent of your conscious awareness) aren't given the opportunity to kick off.",No Slang,even little subtle anaesthesia trifecta remove awareness pain movement propofol remove awareness nerve ending ultimately central nervous system still register pain even youre consciously aware pain dynamic response left untreated grow independant conscious awareness addition propofol generally given opioid local anaesthetic deal pain intra perioperative period even though youre consciously aware pain thats inflicted body pain treated youre effect propofolsevofluraneetc minimize residual pain experience wake pain pathway pathway independent conscious awareness arent given opportunity kick,3

"Answer: For obvious reasons, security at Fort Knox is insanely tight due to the fact that something like 5,000 tons of gold are stored there, and as a result, getting the ability to actually see the gold is difficult and arduous.  This is because if you can see the gold, then you are also in the theoretical position to be able to take some of it with you, and that would be very bad.

Given that fact that almost no one can actually see the gold, there's a popular conspiracy theory that pops up every now and then that dates back at least to the 1970s that, somehow, when no one was looking, some or all of the 5,000 tons of gold at Fort Knox has actually been stolen, and people are actively working to keep that fact a secret.  This conspiracy theory hypothesizes that the actual reason almost no one can see it is because it's not there and this is all a coverup, rather than the more mundane reality that they just don't want anyone to be in a position to get their hands on the gold.

The mental image of a massive heist of thousands of tons of gold from the US Treasury is an inherently spectacular one, and as such, is exactly the sort of cool-sounding shiny distraction that captivates manchildren like Trump and Musk.  Nothing is going to come of this, I assure you.  The last time someone checked was in September of 2024.  The gold is still there.",No Slang,answer obvious reason security fort knox insanely tight due fact something like ton gold stored result getting ability actually see gold difficult arduous see gold also theoretical position able take would bad given fact almost one actually see gold there popular conspiracy theory pop every date back least somehow one looking ton gold fort knox actually stolen people actively working keep fact secret conspiracy theory hypothesizes actual reason almost one see coverup rather mundane reality dont want anyone position get hand gold mental image massive heist thousand ton gold u treasury inherently spectacular one exactly sort coolsounding shiny distraction captivates manchildren like trump musk nothing going come assure last time someone checked september gold still,3

"That's fair, and with the amount of time spent I think it's okay for people to reach a point where the game isn't appealing anymore. While I'm not huge into it, I do know some Squadrons are quite enjoying the fact that Colonisation and Powerplay both open up new avenues to manipulate the background sim and push factional system control more, though outside of the meagre credit payouts that's not a huge boost to background sim elements actually rewarding the players taking part of it.

I'm personally of the opinion that Elite has locked themselves out of ship interiors as a feature though. At least one with any sort of proper gameplay benefit. With viewpoint changes all consistently requiring loading screens, power allocation and repairs all being done from the cockpit, and the general way the game is built, ship interiors in Elite would either be a cosmetic room that doesn't interface with the rest of the game, or require a huge chunk of reworking that would mess with how people set up their ships. At most it would be like X4, where it's a nice thing to have but mostly vestigal (though in X4 you can get an NPC to take over your vessel and handle flying while you sit down and play empire management).",No Slang,thats fair amount time spent think okay people reach point game isnt appealing anymore im huge know squadron quite enjoying fact colonisation powerplay open new avenue manipulate background sim push factional system control though outside meagre credit payouts thats huge boost background sim element actually rewarding player taking part im personally opinion elite locked ship interior feature though least one sort proper gameplay benefit viewpoint change consistently requiring loading screen power allocation repair done cockpit general way game built ship interior elite would either cosmetic room doesnt interface rest game require huge chunk reworking would mess people set ship would like x nice thing mostly vestigal though x get npc take vessel handle flying sit play empire management,3

"This is something I discovered recently. I went back with some friends to play a more ""casual"" Valheim experience, putting 3X materials and passive enemies on.

It is indeed more casual, since we didn't *have* to fight any creatures around, only the bosses to progress our gear and biomes... but that quickly reminded me that the entire game the way it is intended to be played hinges on your encounters in the wild, combating various enemies (and of course the bosses), and spending a lot more time gathering and fighting...

That is to say, It helps to actually be using your gear and leveling your skills as you explore and obtain material for your gear upgrades, and if you wish to upgrade your base materials too. Going around without combat, and not leveling those skills; it's not as satisfying to get those gear upgrades because you're not using the gear all that much to begin with. You're cutting way down on the time spent gathering and therefore defending yourself (and basically not defending yourself at all when you put passive enemies on as we did), which of course was our goal, but then it starts feeling pointless just as you said.

Now, I still condone doing this, but only once you've already played the game as it was intended. That way you're not spoiling yourself of the real experience.

Yes, but there are cases and cases. This subreddit, with their hatred of Vinicius, say he's never played well for Brazil... But that's a lie, he was Brazil's best player at the 2022 World Cup.

Since Tite left, however, he's never managed to play well. Raphinha and Rodrygo have also played well under Tite, despite their current poor form (Raphinha is perhaps the best at the moment).

Now there are other cases that are independent of the coach, and Bruno Guimarães is a prime example.",No Slang,dont think league destroying anyonethey play different style brazil thats destroying figure speech premier league clearly doesnt suit brazilian play style bruno guimarães one best example he developed adapted perfectly league he tragedy whenever step onto pitch brazil whether tite fernando diniz dorival junior think valid criticism issue playerssquad big overarching issue coaching imo yes case case subreddit hatred vinicius say he never played well brazil thats lie brazil best player world cup since tite left however he never managed play well raphinha rodrygo also played well tite despite current poor form raphinha perhaps best moment case independent coach bruno guimarães prime example,3

"Price increases aren't even a phenomenon. They're incredibly well thought out and studied with the sole advantage of profit. It is the ultimate responsibility for SB to benefit their shareholders, not their customers. In a structure where corporate shareholders are the ones that get looked after, customers ultimately get the shirt end of the stick. I fell into the Starbucks trap, and the coffee shop/latte stand trap in the very early 90's. That ended abruptly after I decided to look at my finances more carefully *and* doing some simple math. I was spending over $1200 a year on coffee shop coffee. I was literally pissing money away. I got my old coffee maker out of the pantry, loaded it up and I've never looked back. If I had kept buying coffee till now, it's likely I'd be up to $1900 to $2100 a year.  So. Let's say on the average $1650 for 23 years. That's $38,000.00. At $1650 a year deposited into a Roth IRA for the last 33 years I would have just under $182,000.00 sitting there today. 

Where is the smart money when it comes to coffee? 

And how many 10s of thousands of gallons of fuel are consumed annually for people that are too lazy to park their car and do the drive through for a coffee loaded with saturated fat? 

I mean you could come up with so many good and viable reasons not to throw money away at a coffee shop or stand. It isn't even ""Where's the smart money?""  It's plain old where's the smart???",No Slang,price increase arent even phenomenon theyre incredibly well thought studied sole advantage profit ultimate responsibility sb benefit shareholder customer structure corporate shareholder one get looked customer ultimately get shirt end stick fell starbucks trap coffee shoplatte stand trap early ended abruptly decided look finance carefully simple math spending year coffee shop coffee literally pissing money away got old coffee maker pantry loaded ive never looked back kept buying coffee till likely id year let say average year thats year deposited roth ira last year would sitting today smart money come coffee many thousand gallon fuel consumed annually people lazy park car drive coffee loaded saturated fat mean could come many good viable reason throw money away coffee shop stand isnt even wheres smart money plain old wheres smart,3

"During his last term, social media pages owned by Russian propaganda teams created protests where the right wing and left wing were led into conflict. 

The point was to get them in proximity to the point that violence occurs and drives a wedge deeper in the American people.  

The left needs to learn how to protest in ways that the right can't infiltrate with bad actors that justify use of force. 

Better yet. Don't go to physical protests. They dont accomplish much anymore. 

In the past, it was a demonstration that people were willing to get off their butts and use a day up to make sure they're heard. This theoretically could translate to votes on election day. It also brought awareness to a cause. But now we can just use social media to bring awareness to a cause and boycotts to voice our displeasure.

"I guess some of them out of pvp multiplayer being hip at time, and companies wanting faster moneys, by needing to just balance for it and then not craft campaigns, and others turned that way since they were free passion projects, and did not simply have creator hours to actually pump up that content in addition to game mechanics and balance.

But yeah this is part of it, I sometimes and in increasing amounts want to have some chill gaming without it being ""under massive time pressure since opponent is player playing by exactly same rules and in symmetrical situation where who ever does something faster and more efficiently gains edge, and then has possibility of trying to snowball from there into even stronger position, with some playroom to surprising things or spotting some weakness in opponent, as long as  you are fast enough"".

But yeah stuff like Beyond All Reason does exist and improve in that type of games, and neatly is usually free these days to play.  
Beyond All Reason: Think about Supreme Commander but with improvements to UI and commanding units, with some convenient tools that make you go ""why were these not in already decades ago"", but taking step clear step towards Total Annihilation in style and unit selection and so. And being free to play, without any microtransactions/dlc/monetization as far as I remember from last time I at some point tried it, so like actually free to play, not ""free to feel like you should spend money to enjoy"".

And just look at these controls [https://www.beyondallreason.info/commands-20#Movement](https://www.beyondallreason.info/commands-20#Movement) (you can expand to see visual example of things by clicking on thing there), I suggest looking at ""Move Line Drag"" + ""Move in Formation"" as two very combo viable commands, then ""Attack circle"" and ""Attack line"", and ""Set Target"" (no visual example of Set Target, but overall it is neat).

"I've been going back and forth on this a lot, but finally decided I won't buy it.

Shadows has been a marketing and PR \*nightmare\* for an entire year. I struggle to believe it's entirely incompetence. Like, at first I thought the stuff about the resemblance of the torii gate to the one left after the WWII bombing was just typical internet conspiracy drama, but now their latest special edition stuff looks like... Chinese themed?

I love Wukong. I play Chinese gacha games. It's not about China bad. What I'm trying to say, is I'm not convinced anyone working on this game, or anyone marketing this game or running PR for this game, even knows where Japan is on a map. One of their so-called consultants is shady if not an outright fraud. Even if I try to be as charitable as possible, it doesn't explain totally failing to consult with... actual Japanese experts who aren't even remotely controversial? Who are Japanese? FROM Japan?

Compare this to how Sucker Punch developed GoT, how they marketed it, worked with real kenjutsu masters from Japan, and the difference between the baseline level of respect is night and day. There's really no excuse for Ubisoft. And not even just respect toward a people or culture, but just the effort you're putting into your product, the pride you put into your work. Why wouldn't you seek out and work as closely as possible with consultants who can help you make the best version of an alternate history game about **their** country? Why would you instead settle for a person of very dubious credibility? Rhetorically asking.

In an age where there's so much talk about ""sensitivity readers"" and the like, it is simply mindboggling how these things have happened again, and again, and again, and again with this game lol. So much of this probably could have been avoided if they'd flown a random drunk salaryman off the streets of Sapporo to their studio and showed stuff to them.

I'm a weeb, but it's not about me white knighting for Japan. I'm just convinced that Ubisoft has no effing clue what they're doing. In any way, shape, or form. They don't respect the history or the culture they're attempting to represent in their game, and they insult the intelligence of consumers, and even if you set all that aside, the game looks behind the times even when it's not glitching out. There is nothing about this game I'd feel good about financially supporting, not even for the memes; the industry must do better.

"Answer: According to NPR, they're making this claim because he has consolidated all Ukrainian media into a single state-sponsored network, suspended 11 political parties, and removed officials from those 11 parties from office. Representatives other than Trump have raised concerns over this, including members of the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, so Trump's comments are not new, nor are they unprecedented.

There is also the notion that Zelensky has overstayed his term in office as per the Ukrainian constitution under martial law, an action that, according to political scientists, does define him as a military dictator; a position used in democracies since the Roman Republic.

"This is a big part of why I left Mormonism.  So much of your time, money, and community is spent devoted to it, one’s identity would be hard pressed not to be consumed by the faith.  Any time I tried to be outside of the church, I was reminded how worldly I was being.  I finally broke when going to the temple for the first time and “seeing” behind the veil and the hyper ritualistic behaviors of god’s chosen.  At the same time discovering tithing was going not only to build temples and pay for missions but buy stocks and real estate.  I dig deeper and learned more of the history that wasn’t discussed on Sundays.

"The last resort for Ukraine would be to continue to fight the Russians alone, without a deal, and without the support of the US. That's not only without weapons and cash, but also intelligence, which has been crucial for air defence. That's a losing war for them, so if Trump says ""make a deal or we quit,"" Zelenskyy has to at least pretend to engage with the process to avoid that scenario.

On the other hand, a negotiated settlement *with formal American-backed security guarantees* is one of the best possible outcomes for Ukraine, since it would guarantee military strength and prevent a future invasion.

">How many games do people play on switch that meaningfully take advantage of the switch's unique hardware solutions to make games better than they would be on other platforms? Very few.

It's way, way more than you think. You have to get out of the ""only Nintendo games"" mindset. The Switch isn't a success just because of Nintendo games, otherwise the WiiU would've been a success with that logic.

I have over 300 Nintendo Switch games and less than 20 are Nintendo games myself.

A lot of people bought the Switch because it's was the most powerful portable console gaming experience at the time. The unique hardware solution you're talking about? Portability. Dockable. The switching aspect is appealing to those who don't like to dedicate a big chunk amount of time sitting in front of a TV.

"This is usually an issue of inconsistent original transliterations.

"I attempted to discuss the flood of political things posted in r/facepalm. I asked the moderators why the obviously rule breaking was being allowed instead of comedy. 

https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/2mo8qxo

The subreddit moderator actually made a comment that I should be flea ridden for my (what I assumed to be center) opinions and dismissed the concern I contacted them about.
The subreddit moderator actually broke the rules for the subreddit in his response.

I then made my own political post that only showed a video with facts that is in the same vein as their posts but with news unflattering to the moderators and users. The I was banned. And the only rules broken were the same as their current posts from opinions they agree with.

Is this seemingly fascist behavior common on reddit? Are differing opinions really not tolerated? Is this how reddit wishes to further it's growing reputation as being not inclusive? 

Do the subreddit mods think that people will come here from X (like I did) and not instead flea to X so they're not silenced for expressing opinions that affect their personal opinions rather than moderate subjectively?

Did I make a mistake coming here thinking the logical things I've seen from Reddit was the norm?

"As I understand it, and I could be wrong:

First we have to look at where the contamination would come from: germs in the environment, people touching the product, residue from manufacturing, and contaminants from the material itself.

Second the manufacturing process: a. the sheet plastic is generally made by blowing a bubble in a large vat of molten plastic, grabbing the bubble from above and feeding it through a roller system. The size of the sheet/bag is controlled by the speed of drawing, the feed of air into the bubble, and the temperature of the plastic. The plastic starts at a temperature that kills germs from the environment.

b. The plastic is generally not touched by workers during the manufacture. The automated machines roll the plastic, trim it to size, weld on the zipper, seal the edges, cut the individual bags from the continuous length, collate into numbered stacks, and stuff & seal the stacks into packaging. Humans generally only touch the beginning and end of the rolls of material, and since the product must be food safe, they wear gloves & probably masks. The machines have to stay food safe and are serviced with food safe products. The material itself stays protected while on the rolls by being covered by the many layers of material.

The plastic used is food safe itself. It is heated, fused, and generally untouched. As far as I know (and I could be wrong) it is much more costly to stop a non-food-safe production line, clean the line to safety standards, and start it again with food safe materials than it is to make products that are not required to be food safe with food safe materials. Almost all 3-5 gallon buckets made in the US are food safe even if not labled as such for this reason.

And as an added bonus: WD-40 is a food safe product. I would not suggest putting it on your salad, but a spritz on the manufacturing line could mean a tiny bit of mineral oil makes it onto the bag. Which if you put cold pepperoni pizza in the bag is the least of your worries.",No Slang,understand could wrong first look contamination would come germ environment people touching product residue manufacturing contaminant material second manufacturing process sheet plastic generally made blowing bubble large vat molten plastic grabbing bubble feeding roller system size sheetbag controlled speed drawing feed air bubble temperature plastic plastic start temperature kill germ environment b plastic generally touched worker manufacture automated machine roll plastic trim size weld zipper seal edge cut individual bag continuous length collate numbered stack stuff seal stack packaging human generally touch beginning end roll material since product must food safe wear glove probably mask machine stay food safe serviced food safe product material stay protected roll covered many layer material plastic used food safe heated fused generally untouched far know could wrong much costly stop nonfoodsafe production line clean line safety standard start food safe material make product required food safe food safe material almost gallon bucket made u food safe even labled reason added bonus wd food safe product would suggest putting salad spritz manufacturing line could mean tiny bit mineral oil make onto bag put cold pepperoni pizza bag least worry,3

I was a student in a teaching hospital at the time and the we had a student doctor doing the procedure while the watching doctor watched through the glass in the main console room. Anyways the doctor did a count for when bleeding should be stopping, and the patient didn't stop bleeding to the young doctor's shock. The experienced doctor comes over the intercom and say, ""what medications is this patient on?"" The answer was blood thinners.

"I think you're overthinking it. I hold with the school of thought that emotions are physiological. Studies have shown that we unconsciously mix up emotions with similar physical reactions. For example, sweaty palms and a racing pulse due to something like fear from being on a rollercoaster may be conflated with attraction to the person you happened to be on the rollercoaster with. The idea is that we have the physical reaction and *then* our brains fill in the emotion causing it.

And those reactions are basic reward and punishment. We feel tenderness when looking at a baby because that's evolution's way of motivating us to take care of our young. Dogs and cats show similar instincts. Really, there's no evolutionary reason for emotions except to motivate us to do or not do things.

"Answer: dude has a Canada flag on his username in Tiktok, it seems. I am Canadian so let me talk about what is going on here.

Canada has taken in a few million immigrants in the last few years, with a considerable majority of them being from India. This has put a lot of pressure on housing and job markets, which hurt a lot of people.

The people actually responsible for this are:

* REIT investors, who thrive on inflating rent and enjoy the extra pressure on the market;

* Corporations that prefer temporary foreign workers over local labour. Because even though those under a work visa have a right to a minimum wage, they lack many guarantees and (de facto) rights a Canadian has, and thus make for a more loyal and desperate workforce.

* Politicians all across the spectrum, who could have put a cap on immigration and manage it in a sustainable manner, but who decided to appease to the two other groups above.

We could, as a people, criticise those three groups and work to find a solution to our problems. But unfortunately, human nature being what it is, a lot of us decided to just be racist instead.",No Slang,answer dude canada flag username tiktok seems canadian let talk going canada taken million immigrant last year considerable majority india put lot pressure housing job market hurt lot people people actually responsible reit investor thrive inflating rent enjoy extra pressure market corporation prefer temporary foreign worker local labour even though work visa right minimum wage lack many guarantee de facto right canadian thus make loyal desperate workforce politician across spectrum could put cap immigration manage sustainable manner decided appease two group could people criticise three group work find solution problem unfortunately human nature lot u decided racist instead,3

"Social conservatism is often associated with maintaining or upholding traditional values and beliefs. The idea of a person changing their associated gender, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth, has always been around. But it's never been taken nearly as seriously as in recent decades, nor has it had this high of cultural acceptance. So a lot of social conservatives consider the theory of gender identity being flexible as radical, new, and not supported by science (regardless of whether that last one's true or not).

>I hear the word freedom thrown around a lot but then why constantly try to restrict these people’s freedom to be themselves or whoever they want to be when they’re not hurting anyone?

This is just a guess, but I think there may be a few overlaps here, with the backlash that same-sex marriage experienced in the late 2000's. Back then, opponents of same-sex marriage branded themselves as defenders of the institution of marriage, and that the idea of legalizing it would involve the government telling churches (that facilitate marriages) what to do. But as more states legalized it, and people realized that their marriages and churches remained the same, I think people realized how little validity these arguments had.

Similarly, I think social conservatives have a fear that legal requirements and social obligations would require people to act against their personal beliefs, when it comes to interacting with (or providing services to) trans people. Like it shouldn't matter to anyone else what letter a trans person has on their passport for ""Sex"", But people have outstanding questions about trans inclusion in gender-segregated sports teams, or how a parent can make decisions on how to help their teenager explore their gender identity without jumping the gun. And the answers to that aren't clear or universally understood yet. It's possible that fear and hate will reside once clearer answers are available to the public on how people can reconcile their disagreement with their ability to conduct themselves in social/professional interactions. But yes, it sucks that trans people are on the receiving end of bullying and discrimination in the meantime.

It's true that social conservatives support individual liberties as a traditional American value that's worth upholding, but they also tend to advocate for government regulations on those liberties **for the sake of** upholding values. Whether that's nuance, or hypocrisy, is up to personal interpretation. But they're less likely to stand by the ""let trans people do what they want, they're not hurting anyone"" stance than libertarians, who uphold individual liberties above all else.",No Slang,social conservatism often associated maintaining upholding traditional value belief idea person changing associated gender regardless sex assigned birth always around never taken nearly seriously recent decade high cultural acceptance lot social conservative consider theory gender identity flexible radical new supported science regardless whether last one true hear word freedom thrown around lot constantly try restrict people freedom whoever want theyre hurting anyone guess think may overlap backlash samesex marriage experienced late back opponent samesex marriage branded defender institution marriage idea legalizing would involve government telling church facilitate marriage state legalized people realized marriage church remained think people realized little validity argument similarly think social conservative fear legal requirement social obligation would require people act personal belief come interacting providing service trans people like shouldnt matter anyone else letter trans person passport sex people outstanding question trans inclusion gendersegregated sport team parent make decision help teenager explore gender identity without jumping gun answer arent clear universally understood yet possible fear hate reside clearer answer available public people reconcile disagreement ability conduct socialprofessional interaction yes suck trans people receiving end bullying discrimination meantime true social conservative support individual liberty traditional american value thats worth upholding also tend advocate government regulation liberty sake upholding value whether thats nuance hypocrisy personal interpretation theyre less likely stand let trans people want theyre hurting anyone stance libertarian uphold individual liberty else,3

"Answer: There are a few reasons people are hating on it, ranging from reasonable to racist.

Probably the loudest group of people are upset at the casting of Rachel Zegler, who is Latina, as Snow White.  The most charitable reading of this is that in the original fairytale, Snow White is described as having ""skin as white as Snow"".  The less charitable assessment is of this is that a large group of the people upset about it are being racist, and probably wouldn't have raised a stink about it if a white woman of European descent had been cast, though if you really wanted to be 100% accurate to the original Grimm tale you'd have to hire someone with albinism, cake them in powder and dye their hair black.

A smaller group is probably upset over the casting of Gal Gadot as the wicked queen for a couple reasons.  The most negligible of these is criticism of her acting, but a stronger one is her vociferous support of Israel's recent bombing campaign and treatment of Palestinians.

A third possible reason is the weird back and forth on how they're handling the seven dwarves, with the use of widely ridiculed CGI creations that most people agree are incredibly off-putting.

And finally, plenty are just tired of the factory-like churn of Disney remaking their classic animated hits as live action/realistic CGI at a pace that makes them feel like soulless cash grabs.",No Slang,answer reason people hating ranging reasonable racist probably loudest group people upset casting rachel zegler latina snow white charitable reading original fairytale snow white described skin white snow less charitable assessment large group people upset racist probably wouldnt raised stink white woman european descent cast though really wanted accurate original grimm tale youd hire someone albinism cake powder dye hair black smaller group probably upset casting gal gadot wicked queen couple reason negligible criticism acting stronger one vociferous support israel recent bombing campaign treatment palestinian third possible reason weird back forth theyre handling seven dwarf use widely ridiculed cgi creation people agree incredibly offputting finally plenty tired factorylike churn disney remaking classic animated hit live actionrealistic cgi pace make feel like soulless cash grab,3

Because you got into the relationship not because you wanted to in a sense, but instead because you feel like you have to take the chance. In my case i searched for someone to make me a better person , when in reality I and only I can make myself that better person.

My experience has taught me that whenever i get over that feeling - by making the best out of my life as it is with hobbies, going hiking, spending time with friends, going on holiday alone,… - brought me not only the best memories of my entire life but also made me find my partner along the way. The more you express who you truly are and how you want to live, the more likely you will find someone who is exacly what you might search for - with no search needed. 

In conclusion just do what you love (outside your room ofc) and everything will come together eventually.

I hope my view helps you a little or at least gives you some perspective :)",No Slang,think pretty common thing think especially people either never relationship havent relationship time personally think trap tho whenever feeling make get relationship time best got relationship wanted sense instead feel like take chance case searched someone make better person reality make better person experience taught whenever get feeling making best life hobby going hiking spending time friend going holiday alone brought best memory entire life also made find partner along way express truly want live likely find someone exacly might search search needed conclusion love outside room ofc everything come together eventually hope view help little least give perspective,3

"Multiple issues with making her a mutated Witcher that make it a stretch:

1. Anyone who knew how to do it is dead past Witcher 3
2. A woman has never survived the poisoning
3. Geralt and/or Yennefer would have gone absolutely apeshit if she so much as hinted she'd like to try it
4. She's a lot older than your typical candidate
5. Her Elder blood is sure to be factor in how the poisons work
6. Ciri is already plenty special, different and important. Does her character really need another ""otherness"" hurdle to fight?

So to make it work they'd have to:

1. Invent someone/someway to know how to do it
2. That someone/someway needs to have a miraculous method that suddenly works on women, defying all previous knowledge
3. Ciri's ""parents"" need to be out of the picture for it
4. Take into account her powers, probably by inventing a way to remove them altogether (as they don't really work for a player controlled character anyway)

Not that it can't be done of course, you can write anything when it comes to fantasy, but it stretches the consistency of the unvierse quite a bit and seems rather forceful.

In terms of story, Ciri could (and would, imo) just as well try to be a witcher using her own skills and considerable magic powers. But then she wouldn't work well as a player controlled character and wouldn't conform to the Witcher series gameplay formula. 

So the idea of mutating her feels like bending a character backwards for the sake of video game franchise conssitency.",Casual Slang,multiple issue making mutated witcher make stretch anyone knew dead past witcher woman never survived poisoning geralt andor yennefer would gone absolutely apeshit much hinted shed like try shes lot older typical candidate elder blood sure factor poison work ciri already plenty special different important character really need another otherness hurdle fight make work theyd invent someonesomeway know someonesomeway need miraculous method suddenly work woman defying previous knowledge ciris parent need picture take account power probably inventing way remove altogether dont really work player controlled character anyway cant done course write anything come fantasy stretch consistency unvierse quite bit seems rather forceful term story ciri could would imo well try witcher using skill considerable magic power wouldnt work well player controlled character wouldnt conform witcher series gameplay formula idea mutating feel like bending character backwards sake video game franchise conssitency,0

"Read the article.

It's pretty much explained there that publishers started spending a lot of money on content (graphics, effects, 100 hours of gameplay) and so they need a lot of sales with expensive development. Because of this, games are released everywhere.

And we don't get a lot of sales because

1. Game services are at the top of the profits
2. Point 1 forces game studios to make games with big budgets and refuse exclusives, releasing games everywhere.

I think it's a paradox in a way. As long as gamers are spending a lot of money on session games, single player games and creativity at big studios will suffer. We're going through the 80s in a new form right now, only back then everyone was making bad quality games, which led to the crash.

"Because of our ""first past the post"" voting system, larger political parties have a huge advantage. Smaller parties tend to split the vote in a way that makes it very hard for them to win elections. Consider a simple example with one big party that tends to get 40% of the vote, then several smaller parties that tend to get 30%, 20%, and 10%. The party that gets 40% will win almost every single election, even though a majority of voters preferred other options.

It's not like a proportional representation system, or a parliamentary system where the small parties can form a coalition. In our system, the smaller parties end up locked out of government almost completely. 

As a result, groups tend to consolidate into bigger and bigger parties, which tends to stabilize once there are two political parties that each get about 50% of the vote. That's what we have today. 

Some people do want to change this, but changing electoral laws is not an easy task and not everyone agrees that a change is needed, or on what the right change would be.",No Slang,first past post voting system larger political party huge advantage smaller party tend split vote way make hard win election consider simple example one big party tends get vote several smaller party tend get party get win almost every single election even though majority voter preferred option like proportional representation system parliamentary system small party form coalition system smaller party end locked government almost completely result group tend consolidate bigger bigger party tends stabilize two political party get vote thats today people want change changing electoral law easy task everyone agrees change needed right change would,3

Most single member LLCs can elect to be treated as an S Corp for tax purposes.

"One thing found with Layden, he talks a lot of things contradictory to what he did. He talks about rising budgets and unsustainability yet, he was one of the executives who pushed the path they were on. His quote "" fewer but bigger"" is exactly what was wrong with Sony's lineup of titles that it took Jim Ryan to push indies focus back into PlayStation. At some point his insights become worthless. 

Also generally about Sony's titles, budgets and purpose of consoles and talk about sustainability, I think people tend to forget that most of their business revenue and profits don't revolve around first party titles. First party only accounted for 10% of all software sales last quarter including their ports.  Their biggest profits has always been being a platform whether that be third party sales, MTX, subs and this generation has been the most profitable Sony has ever been. Reason why they haven't fully committed like MS has regards to porting is same reason why they didn't fully drop titles on subscriptions when MS was doing the same and there was immense pressure to do so, potential long term damage. We saw how Sony tested Horizon on PS plus a year later and it devastated it's sales and then they never did a year release on subs since. There used to be a time when they had the mindset that titles drove platform uniqueness and made all sorts of title. Think every generation they've literally lost parts of that identity remains to be seen if they turn it around. Think they better act much faster than they're doing because Steam is now overtaking PlayStation as place where people buy third party sales too. Honestly reading the interview Layden sounds like an former executive who has literally no ounce of competitive drive (failing to see how Nintendo/Steam are direct competitors at this point) and would roll over as soon as stronger competition comes through (which is kind of happening now) rather than looking at understanding why the brand is losing relevancy, how they can go about improving the platform experience. (honestly there's a lot to improve on especially as things are shifting towards digital and I know where I'd trust my purchases more and it's not on PS).",No Slang,one thing found layden talk lot thing contradictory talk rising budget unsustainability yet one executive pushed path quote fewer bigger exactly wrong sonys lineup title took jim ryan push indie focus back playstation point insight become worthless also generally sonys title budget purpose console talk sustainability think people tend forget business revenue profit dont revolve around first party title first party accounted software sale last quarter including port biggest profit always platform whether third party sale mtx sub generation profitable sony ever reason havent fully committed like m regard porting reason didnt fully drop title subscription m immense pressure potential long term damage saw sony tested horizon p plus year later devastated sale never year release sub since used time mindset title drove platform uniqueness made sort title think every generation theyve literally lost part identity remains seen turn around think better act much faster theyre steam overtaking playstation place people buy third party sale honestly reading interview layden sound like former executive literally ounce competitive drive failing see nintendosteam direct competitor point would roll soon stronger competition come kind happening rather looking understanding brand losing relevancy go improving platform experience honestly there lot improve especially thing shifting towards digital know id trust purchase p,3
