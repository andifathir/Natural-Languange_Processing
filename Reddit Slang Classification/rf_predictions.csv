"Answer: Public schools are primarily funded through property taxes. It is an inherently unequal system which gives much more funding to schools in high value districts than in poor. 

However, public schooling does allow for an ""equal"" opportunity for education, no matter the socioeconomic class of the parent. If the DOE funding ended tomorrow, those property taxes funding the public schools, in theory, would disappear. This would NOT benefit renters, or trailer owners. This would minimally benefit poor land owners. But this would greatly benefit wealthy land owners and landlords, as their children are the least likely to be attending public school in the first place... 

So, now the poor will HAVE to pay for their children's education, regardless of if they own land or can afford it, and wealthy landowners will no longer subsidize public education - which they HEAVILY rely on for the education of the skilled and unskilled labor they used to grow their wealth. 

It is just another example of passing the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class (yet again) and calling it ""freedom"" or something....",No Slang

"The difference in structure between the two books is very telling.

Whereas ""Inverting the Pyramid"" has a mostly linear structure from the 1860s to the 2010s, in ""Escola Brasileira de Futebol"" PVC starts with the apex of Brazilian soccer, the 1970 team, and goes back and forth throughout. Some chapters lead to the next chronologically, (like 1994 to 1998) but eventually he will tie in an idea to one that came before and go back and look at that earlier influence and what it led to. The theme is common threads throughout Brazilian football, rather than linear evolution.

If you're in two minds, honestly you won't be losing much by sticking to consoles if you're only interested in modern releases..  but if you're looking for games that you simply can't get on a console, older games or mods then a PC is the best call.

But yeah this is part of it, I sometimes and in increasing amounts want to have some chill gaming without it being ""under massive time pressure since opponent is player playing by exactly same rules and in symmetrical situation where who ever does something faster and more efficiently gains edge, and then has possibility of trying to snowball from there into even stronger position, with some playroom to surprising things or spotting some weakness in opponent, as long as  you are fast enough"".

But yeah stuff like Beyond All Reason does exist and improve in that type of games, and neatly is usually free these days to play.  
Beyond All Reason: Think about Supreme Commander but with improvements to UI and commanding units, with some convenient tools that make you go ""why were these not in already decades ago"", but taking step clear step towards Total Annihilation in style and unit selection and so. And being free to play, without any microtransactions/dlc/monetization as far as I remember from last time I at some point tried it, so like actually free to play, not ""free to feel like you should spend money to enjoy"".

"Because of our ""first past the post"" voting system, larger political parties have a huge advantage. Smaller parties tend to split the vote in a way that makes it very hard for them to win elections. Consider a simple example with one big party that tends to get 40% of the vote, then several smaller parties that tend to get 30%, 20%, and 10%. The party that gets 40% will win almost every single election, even though a majority of voters preferred other options.

It's not like a proportional representation system, or a parliamentary system where the small parties can form a coalition. In our system, the smaller parties end up locked out of government almost completely. 

As a result, groups tend to consolidate into bigger and bigger parties, which tends to stabilize once there are two political parties that each get about 50% of the vote. That's what we have today.

"One thing found with Layden, he talks a lot of things contradictory to what he did. He talks about rising budgets and unsustainability yet, he was one of the executives who pushed the path they were on. His quote "" fewer but bigger"" is exactly what was wrong with Sony's lineup of titles that it took Jim Ryan to push indies focus back into PlayStation. At some point his insights become worthless. 

Also generally about Sony's titles, budgets and purpose of consoles and talk about sustainability, I think people tend to forget that most of their business revenue and profits don't revolve around first party titles. First party only accounted for 10% of all software sales last quarter including their ports.  Their biggest profits has always been being a platform whether that be third party sales, MTX, subs and this generation has been the most profitable Sony has ever been. Reason why they haven't fully committed like MS has regards to porting is same reason why they didn't fully drop titles on subscriptions when MS was doing the same and there was immense pressure to do so, potential long term damage. We saw how Sony tested Horizon on PS plus a year later and it devastated it's sales and then they never did a year release on subs since. There used to be a time when they had the mindset that titles drove platform uniqueness and made all sorts of title. Think every generation they've literally lost parts of that identity remains to be seen if they turn it around. Think they better act much faster than they're doing because Steam is now overtaking PlayStation as place where people buy third party sales too. Honestly reading the interview Layden sounds like an former executive who has literally no ounce of competitive drive (failing to see how Nintendo/Steam are direct competitors at this point) and would roll over as soon as stronger competition comes through (which is kind of happening now) rather than looking at understanding why the brand is losing relevancy, how they can go about improving the platform experience. (honestly there's a lot to improve on especially as things are shifting towards digital and I know where I'd trust my purchases more and it's not on PS).",No Slang

Anything can lead to something bad, sex included. But sex isn’t worse than anything else. You shouldn’t let religion dictate your life like that. I suppose it can be argued that it’s your choice, but as an anti-theist I think your religion is harming you greatly in a lot of ways. I beseech you to find other ways of living your life, finding meaning, finding morals. You don’t need a religion to give you that. In fact, I think it takes a lot away.

"> showed they would rather let Russia conquer and sell the spoils than help defends democracy and freedom

My theory is that Trump is willing to overlook blatant disregard for borders because he intends to violate them himself — as he’s mentioned repeatedly regarding Canada and Greenland. 

“Russia did it. Why can’t we?” Is what he’s thinking. He and Putin have the same mindset that a country’s greatness is tied to landmass and conquest. By ignoring Putin’s boldly illegal and unethical invasion (and maybe stealthily letting him keep the annexed land), Trump thinks can justify his own invasion during his term and get away with it on an international level",No Slang

"Those are smart questions! I was also pretty science-minded as a kid, and had chill parents. So basically had been thinking of it like, god is real etc but the stories weren’t always meant literally and it’s more about the overall message than the specifics. I had a purposeful suspension of disbelief I guess you’d say. 

When I was getting confirmed, our church got a new pastor who made the whole process a *huge* pain in the ass for me specifically. Long story. He also basically said I was going to hell if I wasn’t in church every time the doors were open lol, parents weren’t happy with that one. Told me that wasn’t true bc I got pretty upset. After my confirmation we moved to a different church because of him. Pastor at the new church was the one who responded with the ark thing when I asked what he thought about dinosaurs. I was expecting something about it happening pre written record, it’s one of the mysteries god left for us to figure out, something compatible with what I knew to be fact. Nope. They were on the ark probably. 

Anyways it immediately discredited everything he told me bc I could tell he was making shit up. “Because I said so” was never a convincing answer for me lol.

Edit: also probably the fact that he treated me like a dumb kid like “will you just believe this?” instead of engaging with me or admitting he wasn’t sure but the Bible says ___.

It's pretty much explained there that publishers started spending a lot of money on content (graphics, effects, 100 hours of gameplay) and so they need a lot of sales with expensive development. Because of this, games are released everywhere.

And we don't get a lot of sales because

1. Game services are at the top of the profits
2. Point 1 forces game studios to make games with big budgets and refuse exclusives, releasing games everywhere.

I think it's a paradox in a way. As long as gamers are spending a lot of money on session games, single player games and creativity at big studios will suffer.

"I liked the expansion, United Offensive, better, but CoD1 is a classic. 2 was more a let down, it looked better and was still cinematic, but the constant respawning enemies until you found the spot where they'd stop and start spawning at the next point made it meh. Still way better than newer games though. 

Online, the OG and UO were great, especially UO with some of the Base Assault maps; they were absolutely massive. Though Foy sucked to be on the Allied side since you could hit I think at least one of the bases with the 88's from across the map, maybe two of them. I also spent an inordinate amount of time on what I think was the only Retrieval server the game ever got; I played UO on that server regularly for about a decade. I'd play Base Assault if no one was on, or CTF. Rarely TDM. But they were all generally fun, I just preferred the objective-based modes over death match. 

2 was a major let down online, with much smaller maps lacking in character. Then the shotgun, which was basically broken due to the small maps, power, and accuracy at range. But they had cut the recoil on most of the weapons; a Thompson was as good as a Garand or 1903 for sniping across the maps (which were so small that the scoped and bolt action rifles were a liability). The semi-autos were also nerfed so they were lacking in damage, yet the SMGs and STG/Bren/Bar were just given less recoil and more accuracy. As a primarily rifle player, it sucked on any CoD 2 map. So I went back to 1 and UO. 

I haven't played any CoD online since 2. From videos, I've not missed anything. I did play World At War which was a major downgrade from 2 in everything but graphics. 

I remember enjoying the Gamecube games, Big Red One and Finest Hour, as well as 3, just not as much as 1/UO. I definitely think they should have been ported over.",No Slang

"I was a regular church goer for most of my life, as was my wife.  Kids baptized, active in choir, taught bible study, volunteer efforts, the works.

When my wife was diagnosed with metastatic cancer her treatments became very rough and her health deteriorated rapidly.  This was pre-Obamacare days and she wasn’t covered under my employers insurance plan due to pre-existing condition clauses.  We had been tithing regularly and were giving extra towards the churches new building fund.  We had to stop that to make ends meet but still tithed what we could.  The senior pastor contacted us and asked why and I told him and he asked if he and the deacons could do a special prayer session for her health.  

We showed up to the session, laying on of hands and whole process.  It was emotionally nurturing but her health continued to spiral.  Each visit we got more and more bad news.  Finally, a diagnosis of Stage 4 and she was given only months to live.  We were once again approached by our pastor who asked to come to our home and see us.

During that visit the godless bastard looked straight at her and said she must have some “hidden sin” that was preventing her from being healed and this was Gods way of pushing her to seek the better path blah blah blah.

My wife was sitting there, oxygen tubes up her nose, no hair, down 60lbs from her vibrant pre-cancer self and could barely speak above a whisper.  And he had the gall to accuse her of committing some hidden “sin” stopping God from granting her healing.

I threw him out of our home.  I refuse to worship any God that needs to play with their creation to somehow get off on praise.  That’s bullshit.

She died one of the most wholesome women I’ve ever known and several years later I’d learn that pastor was diddling several kids in the congregation.

If God exists it’s not in any church.  Church was designed to glorify evil men.

**EDIT**

This blew up overnight.  For some follow-up to common questions I’m seeing in the replies to my post….

First, thank you for your support, understanding and even pointing out that one bad pastor (and this man was truly vile) doesn’t condemn an entire religion.  You are right, it doesn’t and shouldn’t.  But I’ve since encountered this in so many other religious settings.  I know the Bible well enough to know there’s literally the opposite support for this belief that “you are being punished for some secret sin.”  Bad people often flourish in this world.  Good people often suffer.  I don’t understand that, other than to understand that good or bad, suffering is the human condition and all faith can offer (often with great effect) is a means to endure it.  

I have been in a few churches since that one, and each of them I felt more and more convinced that its the man/woman behind the pulpit and their character that defines that church.  Which means it’s more of a congregation of charisma and influence than any meaningful expression of worship of God.  Thus….I no longer go to church.  It’s a flawed institution and I’ve found no need to attend any church to maintain a spiritual outlook.  I still ‘tithe’ but now it’s donations to charitable orgs that I research carefully and have a proven track record of actually helping others….and either via coincidence or design, NONE of those orgs are affiliated with any particular religious institution.   

And for those asking.  Not Mormon.  Not Catholic.  Not SDA.  Straight up non-denominational christian church.  One of the larger ones in the region, responsible for spinning off many other versions of the same mega-church.  The pastor disappeared for several years after the incident but later re-appeared at another church.  I don’t blame God for allowing that pastor to continue to live and prosper.  I blame the Church for allowing that….even more proof to me that the institution of Church is the problem.",No Slang

"I think it is a pretty common thing to think. Especially for people who have either never been in a relationship or who haven’t been in a relationship for some time.

Personally i think it is a trap tho. Whenever this feeling makes you get into a relationship it is most of the time not the best. Why? Because you got into the relationship not because you wanted to in a sense, but instead because you feel like you have to take the chance. In my case i searched for someone to make me a better person , when in reality I and only I can make myself that better person.

My experience has taught me that whenever i get over that feeling - by making the best out of my life as it is with hobbies, going hiking, spending time with friends, going on holiday alone,… - brought me not only the best memories of my entire life but also made me find my partner along the way. The more you express who you truly are and how you want to live, the more likely you will find someone who is exacly what you might search for - with no search needed.

"Do you know how your rent has gone up, groceries have gone up, electric bill has gone up?

Well, those costs have gone up for food trucks too

Food trucks are also just another business ,they are not inherently ""cheap"". If anything, sometimes their costs can be just as much as a traditional restaurant in terms of food prep. They still have to meet all health codes. They have to meet minimum wage, and be competitive with the local market. And of course they need power, gas, some type of water access for hand washing, food, supplies, refigeration, etc...

$15 for 4 tacos is $3.75. That doesn't sound that bad when you consider costs. In the US you can easily spend that much on tacos, often more like $4-5 in a sit down restaurant. Plus at sit down, you have to tip.

Your 2-3 for $5 nearly a decade ago is almost irrelevant. You might as well start talking about how a movie and a talkie used to cost a nickel.

"Answer: He was recently a well-established star of Korean dramas and by some, considered to be a top talent. Recently, a young actress, who started as a child actress, but continued to work steadily, took her own life after a DUI 2 years ago. Why is this context important? Well, she was cyber bullied about her crime, public opinion took a nose dive, and basically she lost all of her endorsements and was cut from current and future projects. Two years from that, seeing no hope, she took her life (beginning of this year, sorry if the timeline's confusing).

Recently, her aunt dropped the bombshell that she and Kim Soohyun were dating when she was 15 years old and he was 27. They dated for 6 years.

It has been an onslaught of information coming out, notably that she committed suicide on his birthday. Apparently she also borrowed money from him, but because she wasn't working, couldn't pay it back (upwards of $500,000 in USD). He was apparently suing her to get it back, the agency that he owns was also representing her, and her aunt believes that the agency did not do enough to protect her niece.

Obviously, brands do not want to be associated with that and he was dropped. There's more coming out, but none of the details get any better. Korea has a history of celebrities being harassed by netizens, made even more convoluted by the fact that some celebrities are actually committing crimes or being awful people.

Netizens don't discriminate and go after the innocent and guilty alike. I'm not an expert, but I believe 15 is the age of consent in Korea, but that's based off of a comment I read elsewhere so I'm not sure how true that is. REGARDLESS, a 27 year old man dating a 15 year old girl is disgusting and abhorrent behavior. In the beginning I was a bit suspicious because the aunt came out with the info months after her niece's passing, thinking it was some weird blackmail attempt.

Photos came out and texts, so I guess it's true. Enough damage has been done to his image anyway that Prada has dropped him and I'm sure more endorsements are to follow.",No Slang

I’m also hearing conflicted viewpoints that he doesn’t want to actually to do anything to the parks, and that he couldn’t if he wanted to anyways since the parks are protected. But, if he really is trying to harm/change the status quo of national parks and has the power to, I’m curious as to why, since it seems to have bipartisan appreciation from both republicans and democrats, and is widely regarded as one of the best parts of America.

But at restaurants that prioritize drive-thru at the expense of everything else, they let the counter orders languish until there is a lull in drive through work to be done.  So it's either a wash or it's faster to just go drive through even for app orders.

If it's a place that you can order ahead of actually arriving and where they will just place your order on a shelf unattended, then going inside can be faster, (and your food will likely be cold), But if it's McDonalds where they won't make your online order until GPS confirms you are at the restaurant, going inside is rolling the dice.

"ANSWER: Karla Sofia Gascon starred in *Emilia Perez,* a musical about a Mexican cartel boss who transitions. Gascon was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role, making her the first openly trans actor to be nominated for an Oscar, and she was getting some buzz as a potential winner. Her campaign got derailed when some of her old tweets resurfaced, including one where she called Islam an ""infection for humanity that urgently needs to be cured.""

Usually when a celeb runs into a controversy like this they'll consult with a PR team and follow their instructions to minimize damage. Gascon put out a standard statement right after the tweets resurfaced just like you would expect. Then... she kinda did her own thing. She put out statements without running them by her team. She went on Instagram to try and clarify things without running the plan by her team. She did an interview with the Spanish-language arm of CNN and insisted she didn't do anything wrong, again without running it by her team. None of it made her look better.

In short, she went against her publicists' advice and, in doing so, dug herself in a deeper and deeper hole. That was what Conan's joke was about.

The nurse said something along the lines of 'it's okay lovely, we'll give you the good stuff' and promptly shot me up with fentanyl

Holy fucking shit. I have never gone from such all consuming agony to blistering euphoria so quickly. The hand of God himself touched me then and removed every pain I had on this mortal plane.

"They probably do mean conscious anesthesia (really sedation is the correct term, but it's used interchangeablely) based on their description. Local anesthetic is just going numb you up, it shouldn't cause impacts to your mental faculties. I've worked on patients who are under conscious sedation and even from a professional standpoint, it's weird. They just lay there calmly while the doctor literally has access to your main blood vessels for stent insertion. The main one I really remember, we were able to ask the person some questions, like how is your pain, or say ""we're going to do xyz"" and they could clearly understand but couldn't really respond. I was a student in a teaching hospital at the time and the we had a student doctor doing the procedure while the watching doctor watched through the glass in the main console room. Anyways the doctor did a count for when bleeding should be stopping, and the patient didn't stop bleeding to the young doctor's shock. The experienced doctor comes over the intercom and say, ""what medications is this patient on?"" The answer was blood thinners. Once the young doctor figured that out, everything finished up smoothly, but you could tell the doctor was beginning to panic because things didn't go according to textbook. The patient just laid there with 0 concern about the fact that they couldn't stop the bleeding.",No Slang

But that's it... Destroying was just a figure of speech.

The Premier League clearly doesn't suit the Brazilian play style. Bruno Guimarães is one of the best examples of this. He's developed and adapted perfectly to the league, but he's a tragedy whenever he steps out onto the pitch for Brazil. Whether under Tite, Fernando Diniz or Dorival Junior.

>I think there are valid criticisms and issues with the players/squad, but the BIG overarching issues is coaching IMO

Yes, but there are cases and cases. This subreddit, with their hatred of Vinicius, say he's never played well for Brazil... But that's a lie, he was Brazil's best player at the 2022 World Cup.

Since Tite left, however, he's never managed to play well. Raphinha and Rodrygo have also played well under Tite, despite their current poor form (Raphinha is perhaps the best at the moment).

He no longer answers to his voters, he does not need to. They have served their purpose and are now discarded.  He no longer answers to the courts or legislature.

"I had my purse stolen on an overnight train between France and Spain. It held my wallet, camera and book that everyone I met put their email address in.

We even had to take the train back into Spain to talk to the police because that’s the country the robbery took place in. 

I had to call my Mum in the middle of the night and ask her to cancel my credit cards etc. Luckily, my brother had my passport and hadn’t been robbed. 

A day later I show up at London Heathrow - with only a photocopy of my flight ticket. Technically the Air Canada agent shouldn’t have allowed me to check in using a photocopy - there was a chance that Air Canada wouldn’t be able to collect the money from the travel agency I’d paid, without the original copy. 

I burst into tears at the counter, sick from too many sleepless nights, just wanting to go home. Bless that woman, she let me on the plane after telling me she’d been in a similar situation when she was young and backpacking.

"Rome was constantly reinventing itself throughout its existence even into the Imperial era. You have the Principate which is Augustus through the Crisis of the Third Century. During this time there was one Emperor and one Emperor alone. To vastly over simplify as time wore on it became apparent that one man couldn't rule over all of that  territory alone, and after the Crisis of the Third Century Diocletian overhauled the system into the Tetrarchy, which split the empire into four administrative districts, increasing the # of emperors to four. The system as Diocletian envisioned it was very flawed (senior emperors were supposed to voluntarily retire, they weren't supposed to have blood successors) but when Constantine took over he kept the idea of a split empire, though paring it back to two. 

Corruption did certainly exist in Rome, and in the fifth century in the West, there was an unusually high amount of corruption that *combined with multiple exogenous shocks to the system* such as Atilla the Hun would eventually weaken the western empire enough that it would fall. But Rome's transition to empire was not the instant kiss of death Edward Gibbon would have you believe by any measure.",No Slang

Incapable of understanding that our economic problems are purely our own fault, we'll turn to one of three solutions:

* Manufacture consent for an invasion of our neighbors and former colonial subjects so we can loot them in a desperate, doomed effort to reclaim our former place of economic hegemony.

"> If anything a 3 year deal actually protects his value more.

This line is completely wrong if you're not specifying offering a longer deal in exchange for lower wage demands.

The downside of having a washed player on 300/400k per week is much higher than maybe having to negotiate again in 1 or 2 years.

Saudi is already at a somewhat of a saturation point with almost all teams having fille their foreign player slots, meaning they now have to sell before buying (and their players might be hard to move given inflated wages).

All this also assumes that Salah will accept going to Saudi, and even if he is willing to go, unless the fee is sizeable, there is likely no benefit for him being contracted for longer rather than just renegotiating

" I get what Hong Myung-bo is saying. We’ve been hearing about Minjae’s Achilles for months now it seems like. But I mean the player always has an opinion on this too and obviously players always want to play. Kim clearly felt like he could play so he played. Over the past couple weeks or so Minjae had I think 2 instances where he didn’t start a game and Eric Dier came in (and played well too) but then Upamecano got hurt so Minjae stepped in again. 

I think at first Kompany was hesitant to play Dier because he’s definitely lacking the pace of Kim and Upa but Dier is so good with his positioning and ball playing that he’s figured out how to mitigate his lack of pace issues. So yeah, Dier has started to play a bit more recently as the 3rd option to rotate either of Kim and Upa but this only recently started happening. 

Ultimately tho Kim has decided to keep playing. He got “rest” from practice time to time and I’m sure the medical staff was monitoring him closely. While I understand the frustration of Korea, I just think it really came down to Kim wanting to push through.

"I'm glad you pointed this out. A lot of complaints on the game industry I see thrown at 'developers'. From microtransactions to delays to releases before being done. All those decisions are from way up in management and the publisher, not the lowly artists and developers doing the coding, modeling, testing.

Even more developer-adjacent complains like 'games are poorly optimized today and just require more powerful GPUs because developers are lazy now'. Again, its not so much developers are less skilled or lazy, its that games are more and more complex and publishers are pushing better graphics, ray tracing, more effects, bigger worlds, etc. and there's only so much resources and time to do it. The developers aren't making these decisions and if they are pushed to make it bigger, shinier, out the door faster, these are going to supercede optimized. It doesnt help that hardware these days makes less optimized graphics engines even possible, in the NES to PS2 era software techniques were generally ahead of software and it was possible to squeeze performance out of limited memory and raster, now with frame gen, upscaling, 24GB+ vram, fast SSDs, 300W cards, etc. possible, and the AAA sequel expected next year,  its like why even bother with some of the genius steps devs took in 90s and early 2000s to make magic happen with potato hardware, cartridges, physical discs, platter drives, minimal ram, slow clock speeds.",No Slang

"People don't factor in the subscription when considering the cost of consoles. Over the life of the machine the subscription ends up costing more while locking you in to their store and basically losing your library with each generation. I had friends that bought a ps5 and for years they just sat gathering dust because they had only a few games for it.

I paid about US$1000 in 2014 for a PC and was playing the latest games until it finally died 8 years later, albeit on low settings for some intensive games. I have a new PC now and can still play games I bought for my crappy laptop in 2010. I can buy games that were released 20 years ago for a couple $ no problem.

All the while I wasn't paying a subscription which over the life of the machine would have cost more than what I paid when I purchased it.

I've considered getting a console a few times, it's always been because of some exclusive, but then I remember that I have 0 other games for it and I'd get bored eventually. Plus if I wanted to play it years later I'd be digging it out of a box in the garage somewhere.",No Slang

"We frequently interact with correctional officers in our hospital. I've had far more problems with the COs than prisoners as patients.

There are decent ones, but you'll also find the job attracts many of a certain personality. It constantly amazes me the kind of juvenile, sophomoric, and outright cruel behaviors I've seen with many of them.

Some just sit and eat all day, ordering ""courtesy trays"" from the kitchen all shift and watch movies, then act like you're really inconveniencing them or outright refuse when you try to work with the patient.

I had two playing a game of paper football purposely over a patient's head, leading to the football being constantly flicked into the patient's face. I asked for their names to report, but they laughed and said their supervisor *taught* them this little game.

I went to go to the bathroom to find a CO standing outside it around their shift change. He offered to let me go ahead of him. Another CO the exited the bathroom with a big grin on his face that turned to horror when he saw me standing there. He'd pissed all over the toilet seat and floor as a prank to the next officer.

I've had many that will laugh and make fun of stroke patients with aphasia or dysarthria when they try to talk, some to the point that the patient will stop trying to speak altogether. Similarly, those that make fun of ""funny walks.""

Some will try to get you to refer to the patient by some derogatory nickname that they call them, even though it is clear the patient does not like it.

As an Army vet, I thank you for pointing this out.  

Reddit is full of doomers right now who are insisting that if given the order to fire on peaceful civilian protestors, the military will absolutely comply without a second thought.

This is incredibly insulting to veterans and service members everywhere, as if we are all mindless automatons.

Potentially, yes. Republicans in Congress introduced a federal bill that would require an exact name match between documents such as ID and a birth certificate, which will mean millions of married women run into an unnecessary obstacle when registering to vote.

The author of the bill has pointed out that the bill includes a provision that requires each state to set up an appeals process by which a married woman could show documentation to explain the name mismatch, and potentially still register to vote. This is true. However, critics of the bill still think that is an obtuse process with an undefined outcome which may still impede voter registration.

"Answer: The „4D chess move“ is probably simply the mar-a-lago accord. This is a tremendous gamble on the back of the whole world, especially the people already struggling, let alone the American people.

Check out this (clean archive.ph link) interesting article by Heike Buchta in the Germany paper „Zeit“. You’d need to translate it into English though.

The articles premise is that Trump wants some kind of global economic reordering, by use of the so called mar-a-lago accord. The reason, besides the long term plan with the crazy 100 year bonds, is to make the US dollar weak to be able to refinance the crushing deficit the US is facing, at lower interest rates.

I know, the quote says something along the lines of never attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity or some such, but if you read through the Zeit article, nearly every insane thing Don does - e.g. Greenland, Canada, Panama Canal, Ukraine, NATO - makes sense (note that I don’t think this plan or how it is being executed is good or even reasonable in any way… on the contrary).",No Slang

Since I moved here in the 90's they're still vocally fighting the Civil War. 

When I was in high school, they still had Lee Jackson King Day. All the Mosely boys would muster in the Food Lion parking lot. They'd drive over to the high school in a convoy and stop in the parking lot bottle neck and play Dixie on a loud speaker and fly the Confederate flags high. Then our vice principal would pull them into the office and they'd whine about ""my free speech"" and ""it's my heritage, not hate"" and as soon as they thought nobody was listening they'd call her the n-word. They used to drive around off school property with little nooses hanging from their rear view mirrors. Fucking cowards. 

I'm still friends with a lot of these guys on Facebook. And yes they still regurgitate all the same racist bullshit that they used to. They haven't changed.

The idea is that we have the physical reaction and *then* our brains fill in the emotion causing it.

And those reactions are basic reward and punishment. We feel tenderness when looking at a baby because that's evolution's way of motivating us to take care of our young. Dogs and cats show similar instincts. Really, there's no evolutionary reason for emotions except to motivate us to do or not do things.

"> in general I do feel like people hold self driving cars to a way higher standard than they should


If you are trusting the computer to drive your car, it should be held to a high standard.


Real driving has problems and difficulties beyond what an exaggerated cruise control can handle.


Lets say we stick the current gen of self-driving cars out on the road as self-driving, no human with a license needed. Now what happens when it rains? When it snows? Suddenly everything on the road is visually obscured. Road lines aren't clear anymore, GPS may be interrupted and spotty.


What do you propose the result will be? If the cars just decide not to drive, suddenly everyone in the city is stranded with a car wherever they happen to be. There's not enough taxis and tow trucks for everyone to get home when their cars decide not to drive. Practically speaking, the only acceptable solution drivers would accept would be the cars attempt to drive in inclement weather regardless. And predictably, if they do a bad job of it, it's going to cause a lot of crashes and accidents.


Like, self-driving can't target just working 80% of the time, people need their cars all of the time, even during emergencies. The self-driving has to be good enough to handle the worst situations.",No Slang

"Social conservatism is often associated with maintaining or upholding traditional values and beliefs. The idea of a person changing their associated gender, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth, has always been around. But it's never been taken nearly as seriously as in recent decades, nor has it had this high of cultural acceptance. So a lot of social conservatives consider the theory of gender identity being flexible as radical, new, and not supported by science (regardless of whether that last one's true or not).

>I hear the word freedom thrown around a lot but then why constantly try to restrict these people’s freedom to be themselves or whoever they want to be when they’re not hurting anyone?

This is just a guess, but I think there may be a few overlaps here, with the backlash that same-sex marriage experienced in the late 2000's. Back then, opponents of same-sex marriage branded themselves as defenders of the institution of marriage, and that the idea of legalizing it would involve the government telling churches (that facilitate marriages) what to do. But as more states legalized it, and people realized that their marriages and churches remained the same, I think people realized how little validity these arguments had.

Similarly, I think social conservatives have a fear that legal requirements and social obligations would require people to act against their personal beliefs, when it comes to interacting with (or providing services to) trans people. Like it shouldn't matter to anyone else what letter a trans person has on their passport for ""Sex"", But people have outstanding questions about trans inclusion in gender-segregated sports teams, or how a parent can make decisions on how to help their teenager explore their gender identity without jumping the gun. And the answers to that aren't clear or universally understood yet. It's possible that fear and hate will reside once clearer answers are available to the public on how people can reconcile their disagreement with their ability to conduct themselves in social/professional interactions. But yes, it sucks that trans people are on the receiving end of bullying and discrimination in the meantime.

It's true that social conservatives support individual liberties as a traditional American value that's worth upholding, but they also tend to advocate for government regulations on those liberties **for the sake of** upholding values. Whether that's nuance, or hypocrisy, is up to personal interpretation. But they're less likely to stand by the ""let trans people do what they want, they're not hurting anyone"" stance than libertarians, who uphold individual liberties above all else.",No Slang

More than anything else, Zelenskyy puts his money where his mouth is – he’s a straight shooter who will make his goals clear, then refuse to do anything but work towards them. 

Trump, for all his bravado, doesn’t really know how to *do* anything. He’s pretty good at yelling until someone does something, but when it comes time for him to actually write the policies, he very frequently blunders. Probably seeing even some of his fanboys shake their heads over his public support of Putin over Zelenskyy really shook him, because Trump knows he’s impotent, and is deeply insecure about it.

"Answer: For obvious reasons, security at Fort Knox is insanely tight due to the fact that something like 5,000 tons of gold are stored there, and as a result, getting the ability to actually see the gold is difficult and arduous.  This is because if you can see the gold, then you are also in the theoretical position to be able to take some of it with you, and that would be very bad.

Given that fact that almost no one can actually see the gold, there's a popular conspiracy theory that pops up every now and then that dates back at least to the 1970s that, somehow, when no one was looking, some or all of the 5,000 tons of gold at Fort Knox has actually been stolen, and people are actively working to keep that fact a secret.  This conspiracy theory hypothesizes that the actual reason almost no one can see it is because it's not there and this is all a coverup, rather than the more mundane reality that they just don't want anyone to be in a position to get their hands on the gold.

The mental image of a massive heist of thousands of tons of gold from the US Treasury is an inherently spectacular one, and as such, is exactly the sort of cool-sounding shiny distraction that captivates manchildren like Trump and Musk.

I was about to go to bed after staying up for around 36 hours straight (finals studying) when my dad called to tell me what happened, and I immediately went into big-sister mode and was out the door in my pj’s to meet the ambulance at the ER. By the time my brother went back for the first of many surgeries, I had been awake for nearly 54 hours, and the adrenaline wore off and I collapsed into a couch in the waiting room, curled into a ball, and fell asleep while shivering. The next thing I felt was layers of warm blankets covering me, and saw someone in scrubs walking away. I don’t know who they were, but that little gesture of kindness gave me strength when I needed it. 

My brother went on to make a full recovery (though a little more scarred than before), and is still happily a pain in my ass, even though we are now much older.",No Slang

"Multiple issues with making her a mutated Witcher that make it a stretch:

1. Anyone who knew how to do it is dead past Witcher 3
2. A woman has never survived the poisoning
3. Geralt and/or Yennefer would have gone absolutely apeshit if she so much as hinted she'd like to try it
4. She's a lot older than your typical candidate
5. Her Elder blood is sure to be factor in how the poisons work
6. Ciri is already plenty special, different and important. Does her character really need another ""otherness"" hurdle to fight?

So to make it work they'd have to:

1. Invent someone/someway to know how to do it
2. That someone/someway needs to have a miraculous method that suddenly works on women, defying all previous knowledge
3. Ciri's ""parents"" need to be out of the picture for it
4. Take into account her powers, probably by inventing a way to remove them altogether (as they don't really work for a player controlled character anyway)

Not that it can't be done of course, you can write anything when it comes to fantasy, but it stretches the consistency of the unvierse quite a bit and seems rather forceful.

In terms of story, Ciri could (and would, imo) just as well try to be a witcher using her own skills and considerable magic powers. But then she wouldn't work well as a player controlled character and wouldn't conform to the Witcher series gameplay formula.

Unfortunately even the people marketing it are underselling it as they are not Elon. It can see round corners which humans can't. So it can see cars that are incoming. And it looks past fog and rain.

My basic understanding is that during a shutdown, the executive branch has the ultimate say in what and who is ""essential"" and may continue to operate. Given that social security checks are in jeopardy already, a shutdown would give them cover as to who caused SS to break, and also they can deem all the courts in which we have them on the ropes ""non-essential"" as well. Things like that are what we may have avoided by taking this path.  

That said, I heard AOC say that the senate and house had a plan and that Schumer backed out of it. I want to know what the totality of that plan was. If it would have brought them to the negotiating table and given us a clean CR without the partisan crap the R's injected, of course that is better in every way.",No Slang

"There is absolute no risk in paying Mohamed Salah the money he'll likely want, even on a three year deal. If anything a 3 year deal actually protects his value more.

He's going to be 33 next season but he's coming off his most efficient season ever, and we're so reliant on him and will continue to rely on him due to the lack of attacking talent in world football that can produce close to his rate. He's never injured, looks after himself and has become a lot smarter with how he conserves energy throughout games.

Now the major reason I see no risk in this is that, even if he did fall off a cliff next year, he is the most attractive asset to Saudi Arabia outside of the absolute elite younger talents (Mbappe, Haaland, Vini). Next summer Saudi Arabia are 100% still willing to spend silly money on him even if he does have a down year, so theres little risk in paying him the money he likely wants.

Then for new players, if they come in and want that money as well, tell them if they perform like Salah for a decade they'll get it as well. It's a great structure to show you reward long term success and loyalty to a club.",No Slang

Is this seemingly fascist behavior common on reddit? Are differing opinions really not tolerated? Is this how reddit wishes to further it's growing reputation as being not inclusive?

"Price increases aren't even a phenomenon. They're incredibly well thought out and studied with the sole advantage of profit. It is the ultimate responsibility for SB to benefit their shareholders, not their customers. In a structure where corporate shareholders are the ones that get looked after, customers ultimately get the shirt end of the stick. I fell into the Starbucks trap, and the coffee shop/latte stand trap in the very early 90's. That ended abruptly after I decided to look at my finances more carefully *and* doing some simple math. I was spending over $1200 a year on coffee shop coffee. I was literally pissing money away. I got my old coffee maker out of the pantry, loaded it up and I've never looked back. If I had kept buying coffee till now, it's likely I'd be up to $1900 to $2100 a year.  So. Let's say on the average $1650 for 23 years. That's $38,000.00. At $1650 a year deposited into a Roth IRA for the last 33 years I would have just under $182,000.00 sitting there today. 

Where is the smart money when it comes to coffee? 

And how many 10s of thousands of gallons of fuel are consumed annually for people that are too lazy to park their car and do the drive through for a coffee loaded with saturated fat?

"Answer: According to NPR, they're making this claim because he has consolidated all Ukrainian media into a single state-sponsored network, suspended 11 political parties, and removed officials from those 11 parties from office. Representatives other than Trump have raised concerns over this, including members of the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, so Trump's comments are not new, nor are they unprecedented.

There is also the notion that Zelensky has overstayed his term in office as per the Ukrainian constitution under martial law, an action that, according to political scientists, does define him as a military dictator; a position used in democracies since the Roman Republic.

The study tested the performance of baseline athletic standards such as push ups sit ups and csrdio as well as reading muscle atrophy and rehab levels and times 

It does say non athletic because it specified they weren't using only athletes as that would cause a bias in the scientific theory 

It's a study of average people doing activities to test their performance as a trans athlete post hormone therapy to those who didn't go through therapy. It shows the levels are the same in non athletic individuals because athletic individuals have training and factors that skew results of finding what the baseline change in trans individual is from a cardiovascular and athletic standpoint

For some reason the advice-stasi are very fickle and what is allowed at one point then isn't allowed at a later time. Also I am allowed to post point 3 and 4 as responses to my comment? It's odd. I'm sorry that has made the formatting terrible.  

  
I'm going to go a little bit into my own first time experience, which will be very different from yours. And then I'll try to answer these questions you asked:

\> *What does it actually feel like? What if I don’t know what to do? What if I fumble or make mistakes? What if I fail to make it enjoyable for her?*  

*Anyway, my first time:* I lost my virginity at 16 to a girl who had just broken up with her boyfriend. She had big boobs, so I liked her. She wanted us to be FWB because she found me attractive, even though I was a virgin. Or at least that's what she said, but then we only had seggs the one time. There were people in the room next door, just other teenagers, but still. I'm sure they could hear us.  

She turned on moodlight and put on some music. As soon as she took off her shirt I was on her like a dog. Slobbering her face, hands going everywhere. Our teeth knocked into eachother a few times. I tried to bite her lip, because I heard that was sexy, she laughed and I felt stupid. Eventually I got enough courage to put my hand down her pants. It was way lower than I thought it would be. I put on a con-dome myself and felt proud I knew how to do that. I don't remember much else. It wasn't anything special I think, it was short that much I do know. I climbed out a window afterwards, so it would remain a secret. We didn't really talk after that, she ghosted me kinda. Which would become a pattern in partners and something I kinda had to deal with and still do. I sort of expected that situation would occur, but was fine with it because I wanted to get my first time ""over with"". I thought it would make sex easier afterwards, but I don't think it really did matter much. It took years before I had a healthy relationship with it and it wasn't like the subsequent times were less awkward. It removed some of the mystique, which I am happy for. It was nice to finally know what sex felt like, though I didn't really know, because sex feels like a lot of things and what it feels like one day will be way different than another day.  

So I don't know how it will feel to do any of those things for the first time, since I don't really remember them. Maybe you won't either, though I really doubt it. Take your time, don't stress, you don't have to get it over with. Try to have fun.  

**Now your questions**

  
1. *What does it actually feel like?*  

In one way it's easy to explain. It's just a combination of many simultaneous sensations. You're hugging someone you appreciate deeply tight. You're stimulating your erognous zones. You're having an orc-chasm (though often more intense than one brought on all by yourself). You're looking at something nice. You're hearing moans (and a lot of other sounds). You're touching something soft. You're tracing your lovers body. That's about it. Pretty easy to describe.  

But the whole is more than the sum of its' parts and describing what it is actually like is a lot more difficult. I like to think of it as engaging in several types of conversations at once - The flirtateous, the daring, the joking, the sweet loving, the at-time apologetic, it is often awkward (which is why a sense of humor is great!) I dunno, it's the best I can do for you.    
  
2. *What if I don't know what to do?*  
You won't. It's okay, why would you know? How could you know? Talk to each other. Coitus isn't some solemn hymn where anything except the blessed words of whichever verse you're on is to be uttered. It's something fun to do with your lover, and it's much more fun if you're on the same page - like the rest of the relationship really. Communication is key! She also won't know what to do, that's part of the fun of it (though it's more fun when you're more experienced. First time is a trial.) With every partner I've been with I've made mistakes, be they one-time-flings or years of passion. You work things out together and what works one time might not work another. 
  
I assume you've been told this before and it's really more of a question of ""how do I talk?"" Which there isn't one golden rule of either, but there are guidelines. Tell your partner when you like things, kiss their neck and whisper what they're doing to you that is nice in the moment. 
Something like *I love it when you caress my back*. Ask you partner if they like what you're doing too, sort of like *do you like it when I grab your ass like this?* You can also ask more open-ended questions, but let it be part of a ""game"" of sorts: ""I love touching you, I love feeling your beautiful body. Where do you want me to touch you?"" is  oftentimes better than ""where do you like to be touched?""And talk about what you did after the fact too. You can be more candid and less flirty at that point because you don't have to maintain ""the conversation"". Lying in bed after a good time, tracing your lovers body, staring into the ceiling... Perfect time to say something out of the blue like ""I really liked it when you pulled my hair."" And set boundaries too, there's nothing worse than being with someone who cannot vocalise their needs! Being told ""I don't enjoy oral"" is so much nicer than thinking you're doing something nice while she's really just waiting for it to be over.  
  


**For more unwanted tips:**  
Foreplay is part of sex and it is great fun! Fingering is great fun too. When fingering your partner don't just thrust your fingers straight in and out - Do a curved motion instead, thus hitting the g-spot.   

While being in missionary position place a pillow under your partners behind. This makes it so you're hitting her g-spot too.  

Learn what the clitoris is and what it does for her. Some women like you to be on it like a DJ, others want you to touch it at specific times, others at no times.  

People moan in different ways. They react to sexual stimuli in different ways. Your partner might not have a ""typical"" reaction. (assuming you have some idea of what ""typical"" might be, could be from hollywood movies or whatever. Sex is everywhere in popular culture). That doesn't make it less valid though, and trust your partner if she doesn't and she tells you she does.  

Moan in her ear.  

It really isn't about cumming. I'm a guy and I'm on anti-depressants so it's pretty hard for me to come. Doing the deed is still great. It's fun! It's intimate! It's nice! It's so many good things! If you make it about coming then it will be harder to come. You might also risk that she feels she ""has to"" come in order to satisfy you, and so she starts faking and oh my god you do not want that.",No Slang

The joke refers to a different kind of depression: MDD. It is a serious mood disorder that is sometimes misunderstood as sadness and feeling down all the time. The reality is, depression is a mental illness rather than an emotion. It often comes with appetite changes, sleep changes, loss of interest in once enjoyed activities, etc.",No Slang

"This is something I discovered recently. I went back with some friends to play a more ""casual"" Valheim experience, putting 3X materials and passive enemies on.

It is indeed more casual, since we didn't *have* to fight any creatures around, only the bosses to progress our gear and biomes... but that quickly reminded me that the entire game the way it is intended to be played hinges on your encounters in the wild, combating various enemies (and of course the bosses), and spending a lot more time gathering and fighting...

That is to say, It helps to actually be using your gear and leveling your skills as you explore and obtain material for your gear upgrades, and if you wish to upgrade your base materials too. Going around without combat, and not leveling those skills; it's not as satisfying to get those gear upgrades because you're not using the gear all that much to begin with. You're cutting way down on the time spent gathering and therefore defending yourself (and basically not defending yourself at all when you put passive enemies on as we did), which of course was our goal, but then it starts feeling pointless just as you said.

Now, I still condone doing this, but only once you've already played the game as it was intended. That way you're not spoiling yourself of the real experience. Some of the point is the journey and not the destination after all.",No Slang

"It's even a little more subtle than that.

Anaesthesia is a trifecta. You remove awareness, pain, and movement.

Propofol can remove awareness, but your nerve endings (and ultimately, your central nervous system) can still register pain, even if you're not consciously aware of it. Pain is a dynamic response, and left untreated, it can grow, independant of your conscious awareness.

So in addition to propofol, you will generally be given an opioid, and a local anaesthetic, to deal with pain during the intra, and peri-operative period. Even though you're not consciously aware of the pain that's being inflicted on your body, the pain is treated while you're under the effect of propofol/sevoflurane/etc, to minimize the ""residual"" pain you experience when you wake. The pain pathways (which have pathways independent of your conscious awareness) aren't given the opportunity to kick off.",No Slang

"Answer: ETA is a recently formed nonprofit. It started when individuals with backgrounds in stats and data analytics saw the statistical impracticalities that surrounded the election like winning all 7 swing states outside of recount margins as well as other irregularities. Their information is based on publicly available data. If you are a statistician or data analyst you can recreate the charts yourself and come to your own conclusions.

Basically what they are doing is election forensics. Real election ""rigging"" or ""manipulation"" does take place in democracies world wide however it has become extremely sophisticated and incredibly hard to detect. [Due to this USAID developed a tool](https://www.iie.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/UM-Election-Forensics-Guide-FINAL.pdf) to help detect election data anomalies in other countries. It uses stats and data analytics as well. Personally, I have wondered why election forensics is not done here in the US. There are universities that study it but it doesn't seem to impact our elections nor is it talked about in the media.

ETA started with Nevada because they provide the public with the most detailed information on their elections that many other jurisdictions leave out. They made a press release about Pennsylvania and it is on their website as well. They also discuss more in their videos than what they have published on their websites. It takes a while to verify and analyze data. It would not make sense for them to rush and publish information quickly without making sure it is accurate first. More states will be coming out shortly.

They have collaborated with [smartelection](https://smartelections.us/)s a non-profit with a well established history. In one of their [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOQ-GxJyJN4)s they speak with a chief statistician, [Dr. Elizabeth Clarkson](http://bethclarkson.com/) who found similar irregularities in the [2004 election.](https://www.emporiagazette.com/latest_news_and_features/article_046afc80-d2cb-5f8e-9ced-5798245f7303.html)

I am not a stats person, so I reached out to a friend who actually took college level stats classes and had asked them to interpret and explain some of ETAs and smartelections charts to me. I suggest you do the same if possible. Some of ETAs most recent videos have better descriptions of the charts. When the data is too clean it is not human and when my friend saw some of the clean data it alarmed them as well.",No Slang

"As I understand it, and I could be wrong:

First we have to look at where the contamination would come from: germs in the environment, people touching the product, residue from manufacturing, and contaminants from the material itself.

Second the manufacturing process: a. the sheet plastic is generally made by blowing a bubble in a large vat of molten plastic, grabbing the bubble from above and feeding it through a roller system. The size of the sheet/bag is controlled by the speed of drawing, the feed of air into the bubble, and the temperature of the plastic. The plastic starts at a temperature that kills germs from the environment.

b. The plastic is generally not touched by workers during the manufacture. The automated machines roll the plastic, trim it to size, weld on the zipper, seal the edges, cut the individual bags from the continuous length, collate into numbered stacks, and stuff & seal the stacks into packaging. Humans generally only touch the beginning and end of the rolls of material, and since the product must be food safe, they wear gloves & probably masks. The machines have to stay food safe and are serviced with food safe products. The material itself stays protected while on the rolls by being covered by the many layers of material.

The plastic used is food safe itself. It is heated, fused, and generally untouched. As far as I know (and I could be wrong) it is much more costly to stop a non-food-safe production line, clean the line to safety standards, and start it again with food safe materials than it is to make products that are not required to be food safe with food safe materials. Almost all 3-5 gallon buckets made in the US are food safe even if not labled as such for this reason.

And as an added bonus: WD-40 is a food safe product. I would not suggest putting it on your salad, but a spritz on the manufacturing line could mean a tiny bit of mineral oil makes it onto the bag. Which if you put cold pepperoni pizza in the bag is the least of your worries.",No Slang

A lot of his classmates were struggling to find jobs, but apparently, since a woman got a job before him, he was being discriminated against. He mentioned that a woman with similar qualifications got a job he didn't. 

I asked him why he was so sure her being a woman was the deciding factor if they had similar qualifications. Maybe she just interviewed better. Or, maybe they were a firm that already had a lot of male attorneys and knew that having women on staff might make some clients more comfortable.",No Slang

I’m not really fussed about getting knocked out of either cup because I know we have no chance of winning them. Which is sad because we were FA Cup finalists in 2008 and League Cup finalists in 2012. But that’s the nature of modern football unfortunately.

I turned to my family whom was religious, and asked them, if god was so great and caring why could he not save them both. Was their lives not worth saving in his eyes, were they not holy enough. My (step)sister was a devout Christian, and even god couldn’t/wouldn’t save her? What god whom is supposedly caring and loving lets their followers just die like that.

My religious family didn’t have an answer beyond god has a plan, and is caring. I called bullshit.

"Answer: dude has a Canada flag on his username in Tiktok, it seems. I am Canadian so let me talk about what is going on here.

Canada has taken in a few million immigrants in the last few years, with a considerable majority of them being from India. This has put a lot of pressure on housing and job markets, which hurt a lot of people.

The people actually responsible for this are:

* REIT investors, who thrive on inflating rent and enjoy the extra pressure on the market;

* Corporations that prefer temporary foreign workers over local labour. Because even though those under a work visa have a right to a minimum wage, they lack many guarantees and (de facto) rights a Canadian has, and thus make for a more loyal and desperate workforce.

* Politicians all across the spectrum, who could have put a cap on immigration and manage it in a sustainable manner, but who decided to appease to the two other groups above.

We could, as a people, criticise those three groups and work to find a solution to our problems. But unfortunately, human nature being what it is, a lot of us decided to just be racist instead.",No Slang

""regardless of the legal outcome, I'm my opinion they must have broken the spirit of the rules"" I'd assume would be OK.

Watching it, I realized it was actually really really good. It tells a very compelling story about a Demon learning to defy his destiny and become a hero. The story and animation are very impressive and is onpar with Disney and Pixar (like 95% of the time)

So after watching the movie it’s pretty clear that the sequel *** must have been a crazy success in China. It’s not often that an animation of this caliber comes out and is not from a major animation studio and considering that China now has 1.411 billion people it’s not unbelievable that this movie is the most grossing animated film OAT.",No Slang

"> Nevertheless, Ukraine is getting their ass handed to them and they’re fighting a literal war of attrition.

In a war of attrition both sides suffer. Ukraine may have been already obliterated without support from the West (Europe and US). Especially from an economical standpoint, it is for the most part propped up by European funds.

Russian economy has been converted to a war economy, which still struggles to keep up with the demands of the current war and is not sustainable in the long run. Without a doubt, Europe economy as a whole is way healthier than Russian one, especially at the current rate of contribution. If the political will to support Ukraine is there, Europe can go on for many years past Russia.

Putin knows this and would most certainly like to end the war as soon as possible. Russian advance has been consistent over the past few month, but a consistent crawl.

Now after getting older I’ve come to realize that sure you may have a boss and parents, but the sense of obligation deteriorates dramatically. Yes, you still have to do you work and hustle, but it’s less about meeting an expectation it’s more about personal fulfillment and being able to function as an independent adult.

"On the app it let's me vote too still but I can see the icon showing it has been deleted. 

Idk why reddit changed something recently that made it harder to see those icons when it's your own content or via your own though

"If something happens in her life that makes her happy, I feel as close to being equally happy as is humanly possible----and the reverse is also true.

I take that as an indication that we are still as much part of our two person team as we were when we first fell in love and married, almost 48 years ago, now.

While the exact nature of this love may well have changed over the years, given that the white hot intensity of the honeymoon phase is impossible to maintain, this is more than compensated for by our continuing to learn new things about each other.  I take loving the process of learning new things about each other as a reliable indicator that our love for each other is still growing, which makes me feel younger than my actual age whenever we are together, or even whenever I think of her.

In the most basic terms, I am continually aware of how much her being the major part of my life improves my life, at many times seems to make my life possible.",No Slang

"Not in revenue.  Sony PS group was hurting in revenue after PS3.  PSN was a shit service back then, and XBox Live was a cash cow.  PS3 didn’t even turn a profit until 2010!

I was in an exec meeting back then where they were literally trying to sell off PlayStation Vue to get some more cash.  That’s the big difference… MSFT has SO much more capital to play the long game. They know the future is content, that’s why they are buying up all of the big studios.",No Slang
