"Answer: Public schools are primarily funded through property taxes. It is an inherently unequal system which gives much more funding to schools in high value districts than in poor. 

However, public schooling does allow for an ""equal"" opportunity for education, no matter the socioeconomic class of the parent. If the DOE funding ended tomorrow, those property taxes funding the public schools, in theory, would disappear. This would NOT benefit renters, or trailer owners. This would minimally benefit poor land owners. But this would greatly benefit wealthy land owners and landlords, as their children are the least likely to be attending public school in the first place... 

So, now the poor will HAVE to pay for their children's education, regardless of if they own land or can afford it, and wealthy landowners will no longer subsidize public education - which they HEAVILY rely on for the education of the skilled and unskilled labor they used to grow their wealth. 

It is just another example of passing the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class (yet again) and calling it ""freedom"" or something....",OutOfTheLoop,No Slang

"The difference in structure between the two books is very telling.

Whereas ""Inverting the Pyramid"" has a mostly linear structure from the 1860s to the 2010s, in ""Escola Brasileira de Futebol"" PVC starts with the apex of Brazilian soccer, the 1970 team, and goes back and forth throughout. Some chapters lead to the next chronologically, (like 1994 to 1998) but eventually he will tie in an idea to one that came before and go back and look at that earlier influence and what it led to. The theme is common threads throughout Brazilian football, rather than linear evolution.

And being free to play, without any microtransactions/dlc/monetization as far as I remember from last time I at some point tried it, so like actually free to play, not ""free to feel like you should spend money to enjoy"".  
[https://www.beyondallreason.info/](https://www.beyondallreason.info/)

And just look at these controls [https://www.beyondallreason.info/commands-20#Movement](https://www.beyondallreason.info/commands-20#Movement) (you can expand to see visual example of things by clicking on thing there), I suggest looking at ""Move Line Drag"" + ""Move in Formation"" as two very combo viable commands, then ""Attack circle"" and ""Attack line"", and ""Set Target"" (no visual example of Set Target, but overall it is neat).

And then some building command improvements, like reclaim area, and reclaim area for specific units, and mass extractor update as circular area, and ""start building this group of buildings, but randomize queue order for each builder"" command.",gaming,No Slang

"Because of our ""first past the post"" voting system, larger political parties have a huge advantage. Smaller parties tend to split the vote in a way that makes it very hard for them to win elections. Consider a simple example with one big party that tends to get 40% of the vote, then several smaller parties that tend to get 30%, 20%, and 10%. The party that gets 40% will win almost every single election, even though a majority of voters preferred other options.

It's not like a proportional representation system, or a parliamentary system where the small parties can form a coalition. In our system, the smaller parties end up locked out of government almost completely. 

As a result, groups tend to consolidate into bigger and bigger parties, which tends to stabilize once there are two political parties that each get about 50% of the vote. That's what we have today. 

Some people do want to change this, but changing electoral laws is not an easy task and not everyone agrees that a change is needed, or on what the right change would be.",NoStupidQuestions,No Slang

"One thing found with Layden, he talks a lot of things contradictory to what he did. He talks about rising budgets and unsustainability yet, he was one of the executives who pushed the path they were on. His quote "" fewer but bigger"" is exactly what was wrong with Sony's lineup of titles that it took Jim Ryan to push indies focus back into PlayStation. At some point his insights become worthless. 

Also generally about Sony's titles, budgets and purpose of consoles and talk about sustainability, I think people tend to forget that most of their business revenue and profits don't revolve around first party titles. First party only accounted for 10% of all software sales last quarter including their ports.  Their biggest profits has always been being a platform whether that be third party sales, MTX, subs and this generation has been the most profitable Sony has ever been. Reason why they haven't fully committed like MS has regards to porting is same reason why they didn't fully drop titles on subscriptions when MS was doing the same and there was immense pressure to do so, potential long term damage. We saw how Sony tested Horizon on PS plus a year later and it devastated it's sales and then they never did a year release on subs since. There used to be a time when they had the mindset that titles drove platform uniqueness and made all sorts of title. Think every generation they've literally lost parts of that identity remains to be seen if they turn it around. Think they better act much faster than they're doing because Steam is now overtaking PlayStation as place where people buy third party sales too. Honestly reading the interview Layden sounds like an former executive who has literally no ounce of competitive drive (failing to see how Nintendo/Steam are direct competitors at this point) and would roll over as soon as stronger competition comes through (which is kind of happening now) rather than looking at understanding why the brand is losing relevancy, how they can go about improving the platform experience.

Check your Task Manager, open the Performance tab on there, and if your GPU is showing less than 8 GB of 3D memory, then you need an upgrade there. As for your monitor?

2400 is a massive sample size and is absolutely enough to extrapolate for the entire country *if the sample is representative*, which is almost always the real problem.

People hear about sample size being an issue in some polls and assume that a poll needs to have a large fraction of the population to be accurate, but that's really not true; statistics makes what seems like small sample sizes very representative.

When I was getting confirmed, our church got a new pastor who made the whole process a *huge* pain in the ass for me specifically. Long story. He also basically said I was going to hell if I wasn’t in church every time the doors were open lol, parents weren’t happy with that one. Told me that wasn’t true bc I got pretty upset. After my confirmation we moved to a different church because of him. Pastor at the new church was the one who responded with the ark thing when I asked what he thought about dinosaurs. I was expecting something about it happening pre written record, it’s one of the mysteries god left for us to figure out, something compatible with what I knew to be fact. Nope. They were on the ark probably. 

Anyways it immediately discredited everything he told me bc I could tell he was making shit up. “Because I said so” was never a convincing answer for me lol.

Edit: also probably the fact that he treated me like a dumb kid like “will you just believe this?” instead of engaging with me or admitting he wasn’t sure but the Bible says ___.

It's pretty much explained there that publishers started spending a lot of money on content (graphics, effects, 100 hours of gameplay) and so they need a lot of sales with expensive development. Because of this, games are released everywhere.

And we don't get a lot of sales because

1. Game services are at the top of the profits
2. Point 1 forces game studios to make games with big budgets and refuse exclusives, releasing games everywhere.

I think it's a paradox in a way. As long as gamers are spending a lot of money on session games, single player games and creativity at big studios will suffer. We're going through the 80s in a new form right now, only back then everyone was making bad quality games, which led to the crash. I think we'll come to that too to some extent",gaming,No Slang

"I liked the expansion, United Offensive, better, but CoD1 is a classic. 2 was more a let down, it looked better and was still cinematic, but the constant respawning enemies until you found the spot where they'd stop and start spawning at the next point made it meh. Still way better than newer games though. 

Online, the OG and UO were great, especially UO with some of the Base Assault maps; they were absolutely massive. Though Foy sucked to be on the Allied side since you could hit I think at least one of the bases with the 88's from across the map, maybe two of them. I also spent an inordinate amount of time on what I think was the only Retrieval server the game ever got; I played UO on that server regularly for about a decade. I'd play Base Assault if no one was on, or CTF. Rarely TDM. But they were all generally fun, I just preferred the objective-based modes over death match. 

2 was a major let down online, with much smaller maps lacking in character. Then the shotgun, which was basically broken due to the small maps, power, and accuracy at range. But they had cut the recoil on most of the weapons; a Thompson was as good as a Garand or 1903 for sniping across the maps (which were so small that the scoped and bolt action rifles were a liability). The semi-autos were also nerfed so they were lacking in damage, yet the SMGs and STG/Bren/Bar were just given less recoil and more accuracy. As a primarily rifle player, it sucked on any CoD 2 map. So I went back to 1 and UO. 

I haven't played any CoD online since 2. From videos, I've not missed anything. I did play World At War which was a major downgrade from 2 in everything but graphics. 

I remember enjoying the Gamecube games, Big Red One and Finest Hour, as well as 3, just not as much as 1/UO. I definitely think they should have been ported over.",gaming,No Slang

"I was a regular church goer for most of my life, as was my wife.  Kids baptized, active in choir, taught bible study, volunteer efforts, the works.

When my wife was diagnosed with metastatic cancer her treatments became very rough and her health deteriorated rapidly.  This was pre-Obamacare days and she wasn’t covered under my employers insurance plan due to pre-existing condition clauses.  We had been tithing regularly and were giving extra towards the churches new building fund.  We had to stop that to make ends meet but still tithed what we could.  The senior pastor contacted us and asked why and I told him and he asked if he and the deacons could do a special prayer session for her health.  

We showed up to the session, laying on of hands and whole process.  It was emotionally nurturing but her health continued to spiral.  Each visit we got more and more bad news.  Finally, a diagnosis of Stage 4 and she was given only months to live.  We were once again approached by our pastor who asked to come to our home and see us.

During that visit the godless bastard looked straight at her and said she must have some “hidden sin” that was preventing her from being healed and this was Gods way of pushing her to seek the better path blah blah blah.

My wife was sitting there, oxygen tubes up her nose, no hair, down 60lbs from her vibrant pre-cancer self and could barely speak above a whisper.  And he had the gall to accuse her of committing some hidden “sin” stopping God from granting her healing.

I threw him out of our home.  I refuse to worship any God that needs to play with their creation to somehow get off on praise.  That’s bullshit.

She died one of the most wholesome women I’ve ever known and several years later I’d learn that pastor was diddling several kids in the congregation.

If God exists it’s not in any church.  Church was designed to glorify evil men.

**EDIT**

This blew up overnight.  For some follow-up to common questions I’m seeing in the replies to my post….

First, thank you for your support, understanding and even pointing out that one bad pastor (and this man was truly vile) doesn’t condemn an entire religion.  You are right, it doesn’t and shouldn’t.  But I’ve since encountered this in so many other religious settings.  I know the Bible well enough to know there’s literally the opposite support for this belief that “you are being punished for some secret sin.”  Bad people often flourish in this world.  Good people often suffer.  I don’t understand that, other than to understand that good or bad, suffering is the human condition and all faith can offer (often with great effect) is a means to endure it.  

I have been in a few churches since that one, and each of them I felt more and more convinced that its the man/woman behind the pulpit and their character that defines that church.  Which means it’s more of a congregation of charisma and influence than any meaningful expression of worship of God.  Thus….I no longer go to church.  It’s a flawed institution and I’ve found no need to attend any church to maintain a spiritual outlook.  I still ‘tithe’ but now it’s donations to charitable orgs that I research carefully and have a proven track record of actually helping others….and either via coincidence or design, NONE of those orgs are affiliated with any particular religious institution.   

And for those asking.  Not Mormon.  Not Catholic.  Not SDA.  Straight up non-denominational christian church.  One of the larger ones in the region, responsible for spinning off many other versions of the same mega-church.  The pastor disappeared for several years after the incident but later re-appeared at another church.  I don’t blame God for allowing that pastor to continue to live and prosper.  I blame the Church for allowing that….even more proof to me that the institution of Church is the problem.",AskReddit,No Slang

Personally i think it is a trap tho. Whenever this feeling makes you get into a relationship it is most of the time not the best. Why? Because you got into the relationship not because you wanted to in a sense, but instead because you feel like you have to take the chance. In my case i searched for someone to make me a better person , when in reality I and only I can make myself that better person.

My experience has taught me that whenever i get over that feeling - by making the best out of my life as it is with hobbies, going hiking, spending time with friends, going on holiday alone,… - brought me not only the best memories of my entire life but also made me find my partner along the way. The more you express who you truly are and how you want to live, the more likely you will find someone who is exacly what you might search for - with no search needed.

"Do you know how your rent has gone up, groceries have gone up, electric bill has gone up?

Well, those costs have gone up for food trucks too

Food trucks are also just another business ,they are not inherently ""cheap"". If anything, sometimes their costs can be just as much as a traditional restaurant in terms of food prep. They still have to meet all health codes. They have to meet minimum wage, and be competitive with the local market. And of course they need power, gas, some type of water access for hand washing, food, supplies, refigeration, etc...

$15 for 4 tacos is $3.75. That doesn't sound that bad when you consider costs. In the US you can easily spend that much on tacos, often more like $4-5 in a sit down restaurant. Plus at sit down, you have to tip.

Your 2-3 for $5 nearly a decade ago is almost irrelevant. You might as well start talking about how a movie and a talkie used to cost a nickel.

"Answer: He was recently a well-established star of Korean dramas and by some, considered to be a top talent. Recently, a young actress, who started as a child actress, but continued to work steadily, took her own life after a DUI 2 years ago. Why is this context important? Well, she was cyber bullied about her crime, public opinion took a nose dive, and basically she lost all of her endorsements and was cut from current and future projects. Two years from that, seeing no hope, she took her life (beginning of this year, sorry if the timeline's confusing).

Recently, her aunt dropped the bombshell that she and Kim Soohyun were dating when she was 15 years old and he was 27. They dated for 6 years.

It has been an onslaught of information coming out, notably that she committed suicide on his birthday. Apparently she also borrowed money from him, but because she wasn't working, couldn't pay it back (upwards of $500,000 in USD). He was apparently suing her to get it back, the agency that he owns was also representing her, and her aunt believes that the agency did not do enough to protect her niece.

Obviously, brands do not want to be associated with that and he was dropped. There's more coming out, but none of the details get any better. Korea has a history of celebrities being harassed by netizens, made even more convoluted by the fact that some celebrities are actually committing crimes or being awful people.

Netizens don't discriminate and go after the innocent and guilty alike. I'm not an expert, but I believe 15 is the age of consent in Korea, but that's based off of a comment I read elsewhere so I'm not sure how true that is. REGARDLESS, a 27 year old man dating a 15 year old girl is disgusting and abhorrent behavior. In the beginning I was a bit suspicious because the aunt came out with the info months after her niece's passing, thinking it was some weird blackmail attempt.

Photos came out and texts, so I guess it's true. Enough damage has been done to his image anyway that Prada has dropped him and I'm sure more endorsements are to follow.",OutOfTheLoop,No Slang

I’ve seen the photos of the US flag hanging upside down in several national parks such as Yosemite, and have heard the news of national parks being severely understaffed, but I still do not have the full context as to what Trump is really trying to do to the US national parks and what his end goal is. 

I’m also hearing conflicted viewpoints that he doesn’t want to actually to do anything to the parks, and that he couldn’t if he wanted to anyways since the parks are protected. But, if he really is trying to harm/change the status quo of national parks and has the power to, I’m curious as to why, since it seems to have bipartisan appreciation from both republicans and democrats, and is widely regarded as one of the best parts of America.

But at restaurants that prioritize drive-thru at the expense of everything else, they let the counter orders languish until there is a lull in drive through work to be done.  So it's either a wash or it's faster to just go drive through even for app orders.

If it's a place that you can order ahead of actually arriving and where they will just place your order on a shelf unattended, then going inside can be faster, (and your food will likely be cold), But if it's McDonalds where they won't make your online order until GPS confirms you are at the restaurant, going inside is rolling the dice.

Ronaldinho was great in 2006, but no 86' Maradona.

Messi was great from 2009-2012, but no 86' Maradona.

CR7 was great in 2017 CL, but no 86' Maradona.

The closest would be either Garrincha 62', Romário 94' or Ronaldo 02' WCs. Garrincha had to pull the weight of the team without Pelé, but it was still an all star team with the best players of it's time, Romário's Brazil wasn't great and he hard carried them but alongside him was Bebeto who made up the best attacking duo in WC history, and Ronaldo's was an all star team that still relied heavily on him, but still, Maradona was basically hard carrying by himself.

"ANSWER: Karla Sofia Gascon starred in *Emilia Perez,* a musical about a Mexican cartel boss who transitions. Gascon was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role, making her the first openly trans actor to be nominated for an Oscar, and she was getting some buzz as a potential winner. Her campaign got derailed when some of her old tweets resurfaced, including one where she called Islam an ""infection for humanity that urgently needs to be cured.""

Usually when a celeb runs into a controversy like this they'll consult with a PR team and follow their instructions to minimize damage. Gascon put out a standard statement right after the tweets resurfaced just like you would expect. Then... she kinda did her own thing. She put out statements without running them by her team. She went on Instagram to try and clarify things without running the plan by her team. She did an interview with the Spanish-language arm of CNN and insisted she didn't do anything wrong, again without running it by her team. None of it made her look better.

In short, she went against her publicists' advice and, in doing so, dug herself in a deeper and deeper hole. That was what Conan's joke was about.

"Social conservatism is often associated with maintaining or upholding traditional values and beliefs. The idea of a person changing their associated gender, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth, has always been around. But it's never been taken nearly as seriously as in recent decades, nor has it had this high of cultural acceptance. So a lot of social conservatives consider the theory of gender identity being flexible as radical, new, and not supported by science (regardless of whether that last one's true or not).

>I hear the word freedom thrown around a lot but then why constantly try to restrict these people’s freedom to be themselves or whoever they want to be when they’re not hurting anyone?

This is just a guess, but I think there may be a few overlaps here, with the backlash that same-sex marriage experienced in the late 2000's. Back then, opponents of same-sex marriage branded themselves as defenders of the institution of marriage, and that the idea of legalizing it would involve the government telling churches (that facilitate marriages) what to do. But as more states legalized it, and people realized that their marriages and churches remained the same, I think people realized how little validity these arguments had.

Similarly, I think social conservatives have a fear that legal requirements and social obligations would require people to act against their personal beliefs, when it comes to interacting with (or providing services to) trans people. Like it shouldn't matter to anyone else what letter a trans person has on their passport for ""Sex"", But people have outstanding questions about trans inclusion in gender-segregated sports teams, or how a parent can make decisions on how to help their teenager explore their gender identity without jumping the gun. And the answers to that aren't clear or universally understood yet. It's possible that fear and hate will reside once clearer answers are available to the public on how people can reconcile their disagreement with their ability to conduct themselves in social/professional interactions. But yes, it sucks that trans people are on the receiving end of bullying and discrimination in the meantime.

It's true that social conservatives support individual liberties as a traditional American value that's worth upholding, but they also tend to advocate for government regulations on those liberties **for the sake of** upholding values. Whether that's nuance, or hypocrisy, is up to personal interpretation. But they're less likely to stand by the ""let trans people do what they want, they're not hurting anyone"" stance than libertarians, who uphold individual liberties above all else.",NoStupidQuestions,No Slang

"Oh, you’re looking forward to me not responding? Cute. But since you went through all this effort, I’d hate to disappoint you.


1. Trump’s ‘fascism’—Define it.
Claiming news organizations are “illegal” is obviously political rhetoric, not a legal action. If rhetoric equals fascism, then let’s talk about actual government-backed censorship through social media collusion, DHS ‘disinfo’ boards, and direct suppression of dissent under previous administrations. You asked for examples? Look up the Twitter Files, the Missouri v. Biden case, and how the government leaned on tech companies to silence viewpoints they disliked.

2. Mass censorship—Do you really want to go there?
You’re pretending that speech suppression is a one-sided issue, but the overwhelming evidence shows that mass deplatforming, corporate-government coordination, and ‘disinformation’ crackdowns always lean one way. If Trump did this at the same scale, you’d be screaming about dictatorship.

3. Political prosecutions—You need me to spell it out?
Selective prosecution, double standards in the justice system, and the use of lawfare to silence opposition are textbook authoritarian tactics. Biden’s DOJ has done more to weaponize the courts against political enemies than anything you’re alleging Trump did. Meanwhile, Trump’s actual supporters were surveilled, censored, and labeled as extremists for daring to exist.

4. Forcing ideological loyalty—Yes, DEI is a cult.
Nice baiting attempt. No one is arguing against equal opportunity—what’s being called out is the demand for ideological conformity, where anyone questioning the dogma of “equity” is punished. The government forcing schools and corporations to adopt ideological frameworks under the guise of ‘inclusion’ is the definition of compelled speech. Scrubbing DEI initiatives that actively push racial and ideological discrimination isn’t ‘erasing equality,’ it’s removing state-enforced propaganda.

"I've had like five men who haven't been family friends / family who have interacted with me not be awful to me since middle school started. ( Counting trans men it would be seven ) This includes a guy who said hi to me a few times and held the door open for me. So no, I don't have high standards. Pretty sure one of them had two girlfriends.  ( Nice to me not to thee. ) And one of those girlfriends was always shooting me dirty looks so maybe she at least thought he was trying to get with me. One I sit with awkwardly in class and he doesn't insult me and has said hi to me a few times so I count him. There are some more men but they said such awful things about our teachers I won't even add them to the count. 

I live in a blue state. 

Please don't blame me when I'm a little more unsure of men than women as my number for women past middle school being nicer would be much larger. My number for men hurting me vs women hurting me would be much larger as well. Maybe when I get past highschool this prejudice won't be as needed but school boys at least are majority awful from what I've seen, met, heard, realized. 

Group of boys in my middle would talk about gang b/nging the teachers women or man. Two/three harassed me. My p.e teacher assaulted me and the guys who harassed me called me a liar when I came out about it. Changed middle schools. The first day a guy came up to me, told me to look to my side, then grabbed my face and turned it towards him then walked away. 

I've been asked 'What color is it? is it pink?' 'Want to get with my friend?' ( I was having a breakdown about whether or not I want to go back into a mental hospital, didn't know those guys, they asked it will walking past, not the goddamn time. ) 'Hey my friend likes you!' yeah thanks I know that it should be considered an insult to have any feelings or care for me! 

'Yeah [ my name ] is my girlfriend.' I am not. Was not. Never will be. 'Hey what do you think about my friend?' 'Hes weird I don't know him and he keeps calling me his girlfriend.' I felt bad for being too harsh in front of everyone.  *the guy kept calling me his girlfriend after that so I guess not harsh enough though.* 

I don't think I have that heavy of a prejudice when I'm actually faced towards a guy in person, unfortunately.
 But please don't blame other girls/women for having one it would probably benefit me greatly if I did and girls/women don't owe men/boys compliance and to be gentle and polite and considerate when treated with the opposite behavior repeatedly. 

I've been whistled at in the halls or during p.e. Called a 'mommy' by a stranger.

"Why’s it worrying? I know it’s Liverpool or Villa because they both qualified for the CL and Arsenal were fighting City for the title. But I only know that because of context. I’m a Cardiff fan, the Premier League hasn’t been relevant to my season for several years now. 

I’m not really fussed about getting knocked out of either cup because I know we have no chance of winning them. Which is sad because we were FA Cup finalists in 2008 and League Cup finalists in 2012. But that’s the nature of modern football unfortunately. 

More teams have finished 4th in the last decade than won the League Cup. If Forest manage it they’ll be the 8th team in 11 years to do so. 

Villa won 20/38 games to finish 4th last season. My opinion is finishing 23pts behind the winners and winning only half your games isn’t worthy of the same reward as the Premier League winners.",soccer,No Slang

"His results were perfectly what we expect. If there are no visible shapes to be seen, the camera can't see them. LIDAR and RADAR are far better for self driving. We humans can interpret our surroundings and map them to a 3D ""map"" of where things are in relation with each other. Even before we get to object recognition part, we don't need to really identify object to know how far it is. Having a constant real time 3D map is FAR easier data for computers to handle, the most important part of the process is done by the imaging device itself: gauge distances. We don't need to know what it is to be able to make decisions.

Image recognition is ass backwards: utilize sophisticated algorithms that require a lot of processing power and are almost impossible to make fool proof to achieve something that a LIDAR/RADAR can do without ANY processing: we simply list all the points in XYZ space and check where they are in relation to our trajectory. We can do further processing but it is very simple and fast, points close together in 3D space are most likely part of the same object.. It is all just pure logic, it is not complicated at all. The entire problem with them resides in the hardware that is used for sensing.

So, they are not using the expensive hardware but instead try to do it the hard way that is guaranteed to fail more just to save some money but from engineering standpoint it is INSANE idea. Even if the end goal is image recognition alone, it should be trained with LIDAR in place for a LOOOOONG time because of safety. Tesla is beta and alpha testing with end consumers on the public roads. Everything they do is ass backwards from safety and engineering point of view but absolutely logical if saving and making money is #1.

"I am a big ugly white guy from Richmond Virginia, the Capital of the Confederacy. One of the fun things about being a big white guy, the conservatives automatically assume you're one of them and they just say the darnedest things in front of you. Also, I'm a liberal with a bunch of conservative buddies. Let me tell you, they're PISSED about the statues being removed from Monument Avenue. Since I moved here in the 90's they're still vocally fighting the Civil War. 

When I was in high school, they still had Lee Jackson King Day. All the Mosely boys would muster in the Food Lion parking lot. They'd drive over to the high school in a convoy and stop in the parking lot bottle neck and play Dixie on a loud speaker and fly the Confederate flags high. Then our vice principal would pull them into the office and they'd whine about ""my free speech"" and ""it's my heritage, not hate"" and as soon as they thought nobody was listening they'd call her the n-word. They used to drive around off school property with little nooses hanging from their rear view mirrors. Fucking cowards. 

I'm still friends with a lot of these guys on Facebook. And yes they still regurgitate all the same racist bullshit that they used to. They haven't changed. They're deeply entrenched in their beliefs that their ancestors were somehow victims. And they are continuing to fight the fight. And they are continuing to fight the fight I know for a fact that a lot of them see Donald Trump and Project 2025 as the South rising again.

"I've been going back and forth on this a lot, but finally decided I won't buy it.

Shadows has been a marketing and PR \*nightmare\* for an entire year. I struggle to believe it's entirely incompetence. Like, at first I thought the stuff about the resemblance of the torii gate to the one left after the WWII bombing was just typical internet conspiracy drama, but now their latest special edition stuff looks like... Chinese themed?

I love Wukong. I play Chinese gacha games. It's not about China bad. What I'm trying to say, is I'm not convinced anyone working on this game, or anyone marketing this game or running PR for this game, even knows where Japan is on a map. One of their so-called consultants is shady if not an outright fraud. Even if I try to be as charitable as possible, it doesn't explain totally failing to consult with... actual Japanese experts who aren't even remotely controversial? Who are Japanese? FROM Japan?

Compare this to how Sucker Punch developed GoT, how they marketed it, worked with real kenjutsu masters from Japan, and the difference between the baseline level of respect is night and day. There's really no excuse for Ubisoft. And not even just respect toward a people or culture, but just the effort you're putting into your product, the pride you put into your work. Why wouldn't you seek out and work as closely as possible with consultants who can help you make the best version of an alternate history game about **their** country? Why would you instead settle for a person of very dubious credibility? Rhetorically asking.

In an age where there's so much talk about ""sensitivity readers"" and the like, it is simply mindboggling how these things have happened again, and again, and again, and again with this game lol. So much of this probably could have been avoided if they'd flown a random drunk salaryman off the streets of Sapporo to their studio and showed stuff to them.

I'm a weeb, but it's not about me white knighting for Japan. I'm just convinced that Ubisoft has no effing clue what they're doing. In any way, shape, or form. They don't respect the history or the culture they're attempting to represent in their game, and they insult the intelligence of consumers, and even if you set all that aside, the game looks behind the times even when it's not glitching out. There is nothing about this game I'd feel good about financially supporting, not even for the memes; the industry must do better.

"Answer: There are a few reasons people are hating on it, ranging from reasonable to racist.

Probably the loudest group of people are upset at the casting of Rachel Zegler, who is Latina, as Snow White.  The most charitable reading of this is that in the original fairytale, Snow White is described as having ""skin as white as Snow"".  The less charitable assessment is of this is that a large group of the people upset about it are being racist, and probably wouldn't have raised a stink about it if a white woman of European descent had been cast, though if you really wanted to be 100% accurate to the original Grimm tale you'd have to hire someone with albinism, cake them in powder and dye their hair black.

A smaller group is probably upset over the casting of Gal Gadot as the wicked queen for a couple reasons.  The most negligible of these is criticism of her acting, but a stronger one is her vociferous support of Israel's recent bombing campaign and treatment of Palestinians.

A third possible reason is the weird back and forth on how they're handling the seven dwarves, with the use of widely ridiculed CGI creations that most people agree are incredibly off-putting.

And finally, plenty are just tired of the factory-like churn of Disney remaking their classic animated hits as live action/realistic CGI at a pace that makes them feel like soulless cash grabs.",OutOfTheLoop,No Slang

"When I had my gallbladder removed back in December, I was VERY anxious beforehand. Like, having panic attacks and crying. I've never had a ""major"" surgery like that before (dental, bones reset, endoscopy/colonoscopy were all I'd had), so I was really scared. The anesthesiologist came into my room beforehand, talked to me and my husband, saw my anxiety, and gave me something through my IV. No idea what it was. 

They wheeled me into the OR shortly after, and I was calm af. I looked at my surgeon and his team, and the surgeon told my husband I was smiling and went, ""Oh my gosh! Hi!"" all bubbly and waved at them. I was out not long afterward. 😅",funny,No Slang
