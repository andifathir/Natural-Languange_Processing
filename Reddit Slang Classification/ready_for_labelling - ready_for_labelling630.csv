"Answer: Public schools are primarily funded through property taxes. It is an inherently unequal system which gives much more funding to schools in high value districts than in poor. 

However, public schooling does allow for an ""equal"" opportunity for education, no matter the socioeconomic class of the parent. If the DOE funding ended tomorrow, those property taxes funding the public schools, in theory, would disappear. This would NOT benefit renters, or trailer owners. This would minimally benefit poor land owners. But this would greatly benefit wealthy land owners and landlords, as their children are the least likely to be attending public school in the first place... 

So, now the poor will HAVE to pay for their children's education, regardless of if they own land or can afford it, and wealthy landowners will no longer subsidize public education - which they HEAVILY rely on for the education of the skilled and unskilled labor they used to grow their wealth. 

It is just another example of passing the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class (yet again) and calling it ""freedom"" or something....",OutOfTheLoop,No Slang

Whereas ""Inverting the Pyramid"" has a mostly linear structure from the 1860s to the 2010s, in ""Escola Brasileira de Futebol"" PVC starts with the apex of Brazilian soccer, the 1970 team, and goes back and forth throughout. Some chapters lead to the next chronologically, (like 1994 to 1998) but eventually he will tie in an idea to one that came before and go back and look at that earlier influence and what it led to. The theme is common threads throughout Brazilian football, rather than linear evolution.

But yeah stuff like Beyond All Reason does exist and improve in that type of games, and neatly is usually free these days to play.  
Beyond All Reason: Think about Supreme Commander but with improvements to UI and commanding units, with some convenient tools that make you go ""why were these not in already decades ago"", but taking step clear step towards Total Annihilation in style and unit selection and so. And being free to play, without any microtransactions/dlc/monetization as far as I remember from last time I at some point tried it, so like actually free to play, not ""free to feel like you should spend money to enjoy"".

And just look at these controls [https://www.beyondallreason.info/commands-20#Movement](https://www.beyondallreason.info/commands-20#Movement) (you can expand to see visual example of things by clicking on thing there), I suggest looking at ""Move Line Drag"" + ""Move in Formation"" as two very combo viable commands, then ""Attack circle"" and ""Attack line"", and ""Set Target"" (no visual example of Set Target, but overall it is neat).

And then some building command improvements, like reclaim area, and reclaim area for specific units, and mass extractor update as circular area, and ""start building this group of buildings, but randomize queue order for each builder"" command.",gaming,No Slang

"Once I was walking back home on a Halloween night, and my bf was coming to catch up midway. He told me he threw few random stuff together to make his costume.

I saw him coming from a distance, picture this: a guy with a black cow-boy hat lowered on his eyes, long flowy black hair, long black duster jacket, katana on his side, black shirt and pants with a chain on the other side, and a little white piece under his shirt collar to look like a priest collar.

All so random, and I was so fuckin' turned on, especially for the priest collar. We had spectacular sex that night.",AskReddit,Offensive Slang
