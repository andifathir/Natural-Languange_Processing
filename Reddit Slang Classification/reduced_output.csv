" I get what Hong Myung-bo is saying. We‚Äôve been hearing about Minjae‚Äôs Achilles for months now it seems like. But I mean the player always has an opinion on this too and obviously players always want to play. Kim clearly felt like he could play so he played. Over the past couple weeks or so Minjae had I think 2 instances where he didn‚Äôt start a game and Eric Dier came in (and played well too) but then Upamecano got hurt so Minjae stepped in again. 

I think at first Kompany was hesitant to play Dier because he‚Äôs definitely lacking the pace of Kim and Upa but Dier is so good with his positioning and ball playing that he‚Äôs figured out how to mitigate his lack of pace issues. So yeah, Dier has started to play a bit more recently as the 3rd option to rotate either of Kim and Upa but this only recently started happening. 

Ultimately tho Kim has decided to keep playing. He got ‚Äúrest‚Äù from practice time to time and I‚Äôm sure the medical staff was monitoring him closely. While I understand the frustration of Korea, I just think it really came down to Kim wanting to push through.

"One thing found with Layden, he talks a lot of things contradictory to what he did. He talks about rising budgets and unsustainability yet, he was one of the executives who pushed the path they were on. His quote "" fewer but bigger"" is exactly what was wrong with Sony's lineup of titles that it took Jim Ryan to push indies focus back into PlayStation. At some point his insights become worthless. 

Also generally about Sony's titles, budgets and purpose of consoles and talk about sustainability, I think people tend to forget that most of their business revenue and profits don't revolve around first party titles. First party only accounted for 10% of all software sales last quarter including their ports.  Their biggest profits has always been being a platform whether that be third party sales, MTX, subs and this generation has been the most profitable Sony has ever been. Reason why they haven't fully committed like MS has regards to porting is same reason why they didn't fully drop titles on subscriptions when MS was doing the same and there was immense pressure to do so, potential long term damage. We saw how Sony tested Horizon on PS plus a year later and it devastated it's sales and then they never did a year release on subs since. There used to be a time when they had the mindset that titles drove platform uniqueness and made all sorts of title. Think every generation they've literally lost parts of that identity remains to be seen if they turn it around. Think they better act much faster than they're doing because Steam is now overtaking PlayStation as place where people buy third party sales too. Honestly reading the interview Layden sounds like an former executive who has literally no ounce of competitive drive (failing to see how Nintendo/Steam are direct competitors at this point) and would roll over as soon as stronger competition comes through (which is kind of happening now) rather than looking at understanding why the brand is losing relevancy, how they can go about improving the platform experience. (honestly there's a lot to improve on especially as things are shifting towards digital and I know where I'd trust my purchases more and it's not on PS).",No Slang,2025-03-16 20:36:58,2,gaming

"Answer: There are a few reasons people are hating on it, ranging from reasonable to racist.

Probably the loudest group of people are upset at the casting of Rachel Zegler, who is Latina, as Snow White.  The most charitable reading of this is that in the original fairytale, Snow White is described as having ""skin as white as Snow"".  The less charitable assessment is of this is that a large group of the people upset about it are being racist, and probably wouldn't have raised a stink about it if a white woman of European descent had been cast, though if you really wanted to be 100% accurate to the original Grimm tale you'd have to hire someone with albinism, cake them in powder and dye their hair black.

A smaller group is probably upset over the casting of Gal Gadot as the wicked queen for a couple reasons.  The most negligible of these is criticism of her acting, but a stronger one is her vociferous support of Israel's recent bombing campaign and treatment of Palestinians.

A third possible reason is the weird back and forth on how they're handling the seven dwarves, with the use of widely ridiculed CGI creations that most people agree are incredibly off-putting.

And finally, plenty are just tired of the factory-like churn of Disney remaking their classic animated hits as live action/realistic CGI at a pace that makes them feel like soulless cash grabs.",No Slang,2025-03-16 15:15:44,20,OutOfTheLoop

"I think you're overthinking it. I hold with the school of thought that emotions are physiological. Studies have shown that we unconsciously mix up emotions with similar physical reactions. For example, sweaty palms and a racing pulse due to something like fear from being on a rollercoaster may be conflated with attraction to the person you happened to be on the rollercoaster with. The idea is that we have the physical reaction and *then* our brains fill in the emotion causing it.

And those reactions are basic reward and punishment. We feel tenderness when looking at a baby because that's evolution's way of motivating us to take care of our young. Dogs and cats show similar instincts. Really, there's no evolutionary reason for emotions except to motivate us to do or not do things.

"It‚Äôs like clockwork, just before I go to bed. My hands and feet become incredibly dry. I can almost see the skin stretching due to the dryness. The texture becomes similar to paper. Every night before bed, I apply lotion to both my hands and feet. During the day, there‚Äôs no issue, and I only need to add more lotion if I feel dry- it‚Äôs not too often. However, I don‚Äôt understand why this has been happening for years and how it gets so incredibly dry.

I asked my partner if he‚Äôs experienced anything similar or if he‚Äôs aware of this issue. He‚Äôs never heard of anything like it and hardly ever needs to use lotion himself. Not that we men the epitome of skincare routines, but I‚Äôm at a loss for what‚Äôs causing this.

Within 6 months of Trump entering the race you couldn't send this guy an article, news story, or scientific paper. Even the non-poltical stuff he was interested in. He'd claim that every news organization or scientific journal we would send him was bullshit or fake news. Would say everyone knows it's liberal propaganda and that nothing they say can be verified or true. He only accepted Fox news, Tim Pool, and other republican talking heads/Russian assets as worthwhile news sources. I once sent him more than 200 different sources all verifying and confirming the thing i was telling him was true. He flat out refused to believe me and wouldnt look at a single source i sent him.

"it‚Äôs like when someone says they got x iphone pro so they can play genshin at a slightly higher frame rate and they say they‚Äôre a hardcore gamer the same as you are on the top of your pc pile. it‚Äôs like the top of a tiny mole hill when there‚Äôs a bigger hill right next to it called console gaming and then the bigger hill next to that called pc gaming. it‚Äôs one of the difficulties in using a generic term like ‚Äúhardcore gamer‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the same thing to everyone. 

don‚Äôt get me wrong, i‚Äôm just trying to explain what they are probably imagining and it‚Äôs not really incorrect as far as performance/customization goes. consoles are undeniably more accessible and standardized than pcs which have significantly higher top end. this is neither good nor bad, but if someone labels hardcore as wanting the highest performance from your potential machines vs passion and investment they are going to see everything but the top half of the pc pile differently. 

also and this isn‚Äôt a critique of you, but i think it hurt your argument focusing on the console type and nice tv factor instead of the 30 years of gaming. like if instead of ‚Äúi bought a nice af tv so i am gamer‚Äù you said ‚Äúi beat x game 100%‚Äù or ‚Äúi have x hours on x game‚Äù or ‚Äúi play fighting games competitively‚Äù then it‚Äôd be less easy to read as ‚Äúoh i invested a lot of money so im hardcore‚Äù and more ‚Äúim hardcore so i invested‚Äù. hope that makes sense.",No Slang,2025-03-16 19:30:37,-1,gaming

"Read the article.

It's pretty much explained there that publishers started spending a lot of money on content (graphics, effects, 100 hours of gameplay) and so they need a lot of sales with expensive development. Because of this, games are released everywhere.

And we don't get a lot of sales because

1. Game services are at the top of the profits
2. Point 1 forces game studios to make games with big budgets and refuse exclusives, releasing games everywhere.

I think it's a paradox in a way. As long as gamers are spending a lot of money on session games, single player games and creativity at big studios will suffer. We're going through the 80s in a new form right now, only back then everyone was making bad quality games, which led to the crash.

"I've had like five men who haven't been family friends / family who have interacted with me not be awful to me since middle school started. ( Counting trans men it would be seven ) This includes a guy who said hi to me a few times and held the door open for me. So no, I don't have high standards. Pretty sure one of them had two girlfriends.  ( Nice to me not to thee. ) And one of those girlfriends was always shooting me dirty looks so maybe she at least thought he was trying to get with me. One I sit with awkwardly in class and he doesn't insult me and has said hi to me a few times so I count him. There are some more men but they said such awful things about our teachers I won't even add them to the count. 

I live in a blue state. 

Please don't blame me when I'm a little more unsure of men than women as my number for women past middle school being nicer would be much larger. My number for men hurting me vs women hurting me would be much larger as well. Maybe when I get past highschool this prejudice won't be as needed but school boys at least are majority awful from what I've seen, met, heard, realized. 

Group of boys in my middle would talk about gang b/nging the teachers women or man. Two/three harassed me. My p.e teacher assaulted me and the guys who harassed me called me a liar when I came out about it. Changed middle schools. The first day a guy came up to me, told me to look to my side, then grabbed my face and turned it towards him then walked away. 

I've been asked 'What color is it? is it pink?' 'Want to get with my friend?' ( I was having a breakdown about whether or not I want to go back into a mental hospital, didn't know those guys, they asked it will walking past, not the goddamn time. ) 'Hey my friend likes you!' yeah thanks I know that it should be considered an insult to have any feelings or care for me! 

'Yeah [ my name ] is my girlfriend.' I am not. Was not. Never will be. 'Hey what do you think about my friend?' 'Hes weird I don't know him and he keeps calling me his girlfriend.' I felt bad for being too harsh in front of everyone.  *the guy kept calling me his girlfriend after that so I guess not harsh enough though.* 

I don't think I have that heavy of a prejudice when I'm actually faced towards a guy in person, unfortunately.
 But please don't blame other girls/women for having one it would probably benefit me greatly if I did and girls/women don't owe men/boys compliance and to be gentle and polite and considerate when treated with the opposite behavior repeatedly. 

I've been whistled at in the halls or during p.e. Called a 'mommy' by a stranger.

"Answer: It is controversial bc its not well understood and the waters are being muddied by peoples emotional feelings towards Trump/Palestine/Israel. Many people who are upset about this view it as an infringement on freedom of speech and due process. Additionally, the way he was detained was unusual and caused some to believe this is a gestapo style detainment.

Mahmoud is a greencard holder which is a privilege not a right and like any other privilege it can be revoked with or without reason at any time prior to naturalization. A greencard holder does not have the same rights and protections as an American citizen. Committing crimes is the easiest way to lose this status. In the event the federal government decides to revoke green card status, it would be ICE who would be responsible for detaining the greencard holder and this would happen without a warrant or due process.

Contrary to popular belief, freedom of speech is not unlimited. It is a federal crime in the US to provide resources or support for any designated terrorist organization. In this case, HAMAS has been designated as a terrorist organization since 1997 and Mahmoud was on video chanting support for them and screaming ""death to America"".

Although the US is well within its rights to deny him due process, I do think Mahmoud will have his day in court. That being said, given the video evidence and the landscape in the US these days, I believe he will ultimately lose.",No Slang,2025-03-16 15:17:22,-3,OutOfTheLoop

"Answer: dude has a Canada flag on his username in Tiktok, it seems. I am Canadian so let me talk about what is going on here.

Canada has taken in a few million immigrants in the last few years, with a considerable majority of them being from India. This has put a lot of pressure on housing and job markets, which hurt a lot of people.

The people actually responsible for this are:

* REIT investors, who thrive on inflating rent and enjoy the extra pressure on the market;

* Corporations that prefer temporary foreign workers over local labour. Because even though those under a work visa have a right to a minimum wage, they lack many guarantees and (de facto) rights a Canadian has, and thus make for a more loyal and desperate workforce.

* Politicians all across the spectrum, who could have put a cap on immigration and manage it in a sustainable manner, but who decided to appease to the two other groups above.

We could, as a people, criticise those three groups and work to find a solution to our problems. But unfortunately, human nature being what it is, a lot of us decided to just be racist instead.",No Slang,2025-03-11 05:56:01,83,OutOfTheLoop

Brothers was a single player game in which you controlled both characters with a single controller, one side for each. Co-op was added in the remake, but it's very much not the same core/concept. Whereas the co-op in Way Out/Takes Two/Split Fiction all mesh together seamlessly in how you need to work together, with Brothers it's still apparent it was a single player game and could all be done with the use of a single controller.

"> If anything a 3 year deal actually protects his value more.

This line is completely wrong if you're not specifying offering a longer deal in exchange for lower wage demands.

The downside of having a washed player on 300/400k per week is much higher than maybe having to negotiate again in 1 or 2 years.

Saudi is already at a somewhat of a saturation point with almost all teams having fille their foreign player slots, meaning they now have to sell before buying (and their players might be hard to move given inflated wages).

All this also assumes that Salah will accept going to Saudi, and even if he is willing to go, unless the fee is sizeable, there is likely no benefit for him being contracted for longer rather than just renegotiating

"The frustration with them as non-Liverpool or Man United fans is that they clearly each know their own clubs in depth and behind the scenes, so can provide thoughtful analysis and opinion based on that. Then you have them commenting on Arsenal, Spurs, Chelsea etc and they revert to soundbites and lazy analysis. 

As fans of those clubs, we follow them obsessively. We live and breath information relating to our respective clubs. We know all the background, the main characters, the minor characters, we know all the problems in depth, we can see the positives even when everything looks to be falling apart from the outside.

"Because of our ""first past the post"" voting system, larger political parties have a huge advantage. Smaller parties tend to split the vote in a way that makes it very hard for them to win elections. Consider a simple example with one big party that tends to get 40% of the vote, then several smaller parties that tend to get 30%, 20%, and 10%. The party that gets 40% will win almost every single election, even though a majority of voters preferred other options.

It's not like a proportional representation system, or a parliamentary system where the small parties can form a coalition. In our system, the smaller parties end up locked out of government almost completely. 

As a result, groups tend to consolidate into bigger and bigger parties, which tends to stabilize once there are two political parties that each get about 50% of the vote. That's what we have today. 

Some people do want to change this, but changing electoral laws is not an easy task and not everyone agrees that a change is needed, or on what the right change would be.",No Slang,2025-03-01 15:36:19,3,NoStupidQuestions

"His results were perfectly what we expect. If there are no visible shapes to be seen, the camera can't see them. LIDAR and RADAR are far better for self driving. We humans can interpret our surroundings and map them to a 3D ""map"" of where things are in relation with each other. Even before we get to object recognition part, we don't need to really identify object to know how far it is. Having a constant real time 3D map is FAR easier data for computers to handle, the most important part of the process is done by the imaging device itself: gauge distances. We don't need to know what it is to be able to make decisions.

Image recognition is ass backwards: utilize sophisticated algorithms that require a lot of processing power and are almost impossible to make fool proof to achieve something that a LIDAR/RADAR can do without ANY processing: we simply list all the points in XYZ space and check where they are in relation to our trajectory. We can do further processing but it is very simple and fast, points close together in 3D space are most likely part of the same object.. It is all just pure logic, it is not complicated at all. The entire problem with them resides in the hardware that is used for sensing.

So, they are not using the expensive hardware but instead try to do it the hard way that is guaranteed to fail more just to save some money but from engineering standpoint it is INSANE idea. Even if the end goal is image recognition alone, it should be trained with LIDAR in place for a LOOOOONG time because of safety. Tesla is beta and alpha testing with end consumers on the public roads. Everything they do is ass backwards from safety and engineering point of view but absolutely logical if saving and making money is #1.

"I was a regular church goer for most of my life, as was my wife.  Kids baptized, active in choir, taught bible study, volunteer efforts, the works.

When my wife was diagnosed with metastatic cancer her treatments became very rough and her health deteriorated rapidly.  This was pre-Obamacare days and she wasn‚Äôt covered under my employers insurance plan due to pre-existing condition clauses.  We had been tithing regularly and were giving extra towards the churches new building fund.  We had to stop that to make ends meet but still tithed what we could.  The senior pastor contacted us and asked why and I told him and he asked if he and the deacons could do a special prayer session for her health.  

We showed up to the session, laying on of hands and whole process.  It was emotionally nurturing but her health continued to spiral.  Each visit we got more and more bad news.  Finally, a diagnosis of Stage 4 and she was given only months to live.  We were once again approached by our pastor who asked to come to our home and see us.

During that visit the godless bastard looked straight at her and said she must have some ‚Äúhidden sin‚Äù that was preventing her from being healed and this was Gods way of pushing her to seek the better path blah blah blah.

My wife was sitting there, oxygen tubes up her nose, no hair, down 60lbs from her vibrant pre-cancer self and could barely speak above a whisper.  And he had the gall to accuse her of committing some hidden ‚Äúsin‚Äù stopping God from granting her healing.

I threw him out of our home.  I refuse to worship any God that needs to play with their creation to somehow get off on praise.  That‚Äôs bullshit.

She died one of the most wholesome women I‚Äôve ever known and several years later I‚Äôd learn that pastor was diddling several kids in the congregation.

If God exists it‚Äôs not in any church.  Church was designed to glorify evil men.

**EDIT**

This blew up overnight.  For some follow-up to common questions I‚Äôm seeing in the replies to my post‚Ä¶.

First, thank you for your support, understanding and even pointing out that one bad pastor (and this man was truly vile) doesn‚Äôt condemn an entire religion.  You are right, it doesn‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt.  But I‚Äôve since encountered this in so many other religious settings.  I know the Bible well enough to know there‚Äôs literally the opposite support for this belief that ‚Äúyou are being punished for some secret sin.‚Äù  Bad people often flourish in this world.  Good people often suffer.  I don‚Äôt understand that, other than to understand that good or bad, suffering is the human condition and all faith can offer (often with great effect) is a means to endure it.  

I have been in a few churches since that one, and each of them I felt more and more convinced that its the man/woman behind the pulpit and their character that defines that church.  Which means it‚Äôs more of a congregation of charisma and influence than any meaningful expression of worship of God.  Thus‚Ä¶.I no longer go to church.  It‚Äôs a flawed institution and I‚Äôve found no need to attend any church to maintain a spiritual outlook.  I still ‚Äòtithe‚Äô but now it‚Äôs donations to charitable orgs that I research carefully and have a proven track record of actually helping others‚Ä¶.and either via coincidence or design, NONE of those orgs are affiliated with any particular religious institution.   

And for those asking.  Not Mormon.  Not Catholic.  Not SDA.  Straight up non-denominational christian church.  One of the larger ones in the region, responsible for spinning off many other versions of the same mega-church.  The pastor disappeared for several years after the incident but later re-appeared at another church.  I don‚Äôt blame God for allowing that pastor to continue to live and prosper.  I blame the Church for allowing that‚Ä¶.even more proof to me that the institution of Church is the problem.",No Slang,2025-03-17 03:09:30,13497,AskReddit

Having said that that, it's just a plain lie to say there's ""no point joining Arsenal"" and it's very unrealistic to say ""he can do all that at Newcastle"" (by ""major trophy"" I mean PL or CL) with how the clubs are set right now. All I intended was that right now we're in a better position to win the league or a European trophy, there's nothing controversial about that. We haven't done it yet, but we're closer than you are and it's not even particularly close. Maybe you'll be in a better position than us in 5 years but as it stands currently we're a better (and younger, thus sustainable) squad, we've had better league results, we're CL regulars etc. Winning the 3rd domestic competition is good but if a player has serious ambition that's not going to cut it (and we're 1-1 in that regard under our respective current ownerships anyway so you can hardly get carried away).

">USA alienated itself from the rest of the world, again. Showed they would rather let Russia conquer and sell the spoils than help defend democracy and freedom. Any goodwill America had is essentially gone now.

I dont think people fully grasp what this means. Ever since the end of WW2, so roughly 80 years, the United States has been the unquestioned leader of the Western World. Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, roughly 40 years, the United States has been the unquestioned leader of the entire World. That has changed today.

Every time the US pushes for favorable trade conditions with any part of the world, the rest of the western world pushes alongside for those conditions. Every western nation purchases goods but especially sophisticated weaponry and looks to the United States to set standards for their military. Most of these nations either have little or no domestic military industry, meaning they spend all of that money with US based companies or through licensing agreements. That has changed today.

By publicly throwing an ally under the bus the rest of the world has been very publicly shown they cannot ever rely on the US to cultivate shared interests and when once a joint and standardized military arrangement like NATO was seen as an incredible strength, it is now an incredible liability.

"There is absolute no risk in paying Mohamed Salah the money he'll likely want, even on a three year deal. If anything a 3 year deal actually protects his value more.

He's going to be 33 next season but he's coming off his most efficient season ever, and we're so reliant on him and will continue to rely on him due to the lack of attacking talent in world football that can produce close to his rate. He's never injured, looks after himself and has become a lot smarter with how he conserves energy throughout games.

Now the major reason I see no risk in this is that, even if he did fall off a cliff next year, he is the most attractive asset to Saudi Arabia outside of the absolute elite younger talents (Mbappe, Haaland, Vini). Next summer Saudi Arabia are 100% still willing to spend silly money on him even if he does have a down year, so theres little risk in paying him the money he likely wants.

Then for new players, if they come in and want that money as well, tell them if they perform like Salah for a decade they'll get it as well. It's a great structure to show you reward long term success and loyalty to a club.",No Slang,2025-03-18 12:13:45,1,soccer

">¬†in general I do feel like people hold self driving cars to a way higher standard than they should


If you are trusting the computer to drive your car, it should be held to a high standard.


Real driving has problems and difficulties beyond what an exaggerated cruise control can handle.


Lets say we stick the current gen of self-driving cars out on the road as self-driving, no human with a license needed. Now what happens when it rains? When it snows? Suddenly everything on the road is visually obscured. Road lines aren't clear anymore, GPS may be interrupted and spotty.


What do you propose the result will be? If the cars just decide not to drive, suddenly everyone in the city is stranded with a car wherever they happen to be. There's not enough taxis and tow trucks for everyone to get home when their cars decide not to drive. Practically speaking, the only acceptable solution drivers would accept would be the cars attempt to drive in inclement weather regardless. And predictably, if they do a bad job of it, it's going to cause a lot of crashes and accidents.


Like, self-driving can't target just working 80% of the time, people need their cars all of the time, even during emergencies. The self-driving has to be good enough to handle the worst situations.",No Slang,2025-03-17 15:27:17,6,OutOfTheLoop

There are decent ones, but you'll also find the job attracts many of a certain personality. It constantly amazes me the kind of juvenile, sophomoric, and outright cruel behaviors I've seen with many of them.

Some just sit and eat all day, ordering ""courtesy trays"" from the kitchen all shift and watch movies, then act like you're really inconveniencing them or outright refuse when you try to work with the patient.

I had two playing a game of paper football purposely over a patient's head, leading to the football being constantly flicked into the patient's face. I asked for their names to report, but they laughed and said their supervisor *taught* them this little game.

I went to go to the bathroom to find a CO standing outside it around their shift change. He offered to let me go ahead of him. Another CO the exited the bathroom with a big grin on his face that turned to horror when he saw me standing there. He'd pissed all over the toilet seat and floor as a prank to the next officer.

I've had many that will laugh and make fun of stroke patients with aphasia or dysarthria when they try to talk, some to the point that the patient will stop trying to speak altogether. Similarly, those that make fun of ""funny walks.""

Some will try to get you to refer to the patient by some derogatory nickname that they call them, even though it is clear the patient does not like it.

The way you phrase your comment, I feel like you lean towards it being the fault of citizens and companies over extending themselves, but who sets the policy and creates the environment for them to do so?

\*As it goes up and down in increments, it will shift between ""Ranks"" where certain mechanics change such as damage multipliers and enemy aggression.  
\*Professional is always locked to Rank 10.  
\*Easy treats all Ranks above 5 as if it were Rank 5 game mechanic-wise, but still ""keeps track"" as if it were Normal difficulty.\*Enemy aggression is hard to quantify, but as an example, Del Lago rarely touches stumps at Rank 5 and mostly swims in straight lines. At Rank 10, it will constantly hit stumps. One ""nice"" thing about Pro is that, since enemies are always at maximum aggression, their behavior becomes more predictable. Lower Adaptive Difficulty will have them take pauses between attacks and run at you less often.

You had a lot of good stuff in your answer but I wanted to clarify one point. Starbucks isn't losing money. [In Q4 they 'made' (had a net revenue of) ""$909.3 million, or 80 cents per share,"" which is ""down from $1.22 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier.""](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/starbucks-sbux-q4-2024-earnings.html)   
  
The issue is the declining revenue despite growing the number of stores by [""722 net new stores in Q4, ending the period with 40,199 stores"" and a "" 2% increase in average ticket.""](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241030463090/en/)

"Rome was constantly reinventing itself throughout its existence even into the Imperial era. You have the Principate which is Augustus through the Crisis of the Third Century.

To vastly over simplify as time wore on it became apparent that one man couldn't rule over all of that  territory alone, and after the Crisis of the Third Century Diocletian overhauled the system into the Tetrarchy, which split the empire into four administrative districts, increasing the # of emperors to four. The system as Diocletian envisioned it was very flawed (senior emperors were supposed to voluntarily retire, they weren't supposed to have blood successors) but when Constantine took over he kept the idea of a split empire, though paring it back to two. 

Corruption did certainly exist in Rome, and in the fifth century in the West, there was an unusually high amount of corruption that *combined with multiple exogenous shocks to the system* such as Atilla the Hun would eventually weaken the western empire enough that it would fall.

Then our vice principal would pull them into the office and they'd whine about ""my free speech"" and ""it's my heritage, not hate"" and as soon as they thought nobody was listening they'd call her the n-word. They used to drive around off school property with little nooses hanging from their rear view mirrors. Fucking cowards.

https://www.reddit.com/message/messages/2mo8qxo

The subreddit moderator actually made a comment that I should be flea ridden for my (what I assumed to be center) opinions and dismissed the concern I contacted them about.
The subreddit moderator actually broke the rules for the subreddit in his response.

I then made my own political post that only showed a video with facts that is in the same vein as their posts but with news unflattering to the moderators and users. The I was banned. And the only rules broken were the same as their current posts from opinions they agree with.

Is this seemingly fascist behavior common on reddit? Are differing opinions really not tolerated? Is this how reddit wishes to further it's growing reputation as being not inclusive? 

Do the subreddit mods think that people will come here from X (like I did) and not instead flea to X so they're not silenced for expressing opinions that affect their personal opinions rather than moderate subjectively?

Did I make a mistake coming here thinking the logical things I've seen from Reddit was the norm?

They were having an online deal, so bought 2 from there. I think I was supposed to have been charged $40?  It kept getting delayed. They charged me when I finally got it, and charged $50ish dollars.

It is the ultimate responsibility for SB to benefit their shareholders, not their customers. In a structure where corporate shareholders are the ones that get looked after, customers ultimately get the shirt end of the stick. I fell into the Starbucks trap, and the coffee shop/latte stand trap in the very early 90's. That ended abruptly after I decided to look at my finances more carefully *and* doing some simple math. I was spending over $1200 a year on coffee shop coffee. I was literally pissing money away. I got my old coffee maker out of the pantry, loaded it up and I've never looked back. If I had kept buying coffee till now, it's likely I'd be up to $1900 to $2100 a year.  So. Let's say on the average $1650 for 23 years. That's $38,000.00. At $1650 a year deposited into a Roth IRA for the last 33 years I would have just under $182,000.00 sitting there today. 

Where is the smart money when it comes to coffee? 

And how many 10s of thousands of gallons of fuel are consumed annually for people that are too lazy to park their car and do the drive through for a coffee loaded with saturated fat?

"This varies by restaurant so there is no one right answer.

But at restaurants that prioritize drive-thru at the expense of everything else, they let the counter orders languish until there is a lull in drive through work to be done.  So it's either a wash or it's faster to just go drive through even for app orders.

If it's a place that you can order ahead of actually arriving and where they will just place your order on a shelf unattended, then going inside can be faster, (and your food will likely be cold), But if it's McDonalds where they won't make your online order until GPS confirms you are at the restaurant, going inside is rolling the dice.

"As I understand it, and I could be wrong:

First we have to look at where the contamination would come from: germs in the environment, people touching the product, residue from manufacturing, and contaminants from the material itself.

Second the manufacturing process: a. the sheet plastic is generally made by blowing a bubble in a large vat of molten plastic, grabbing the bubble from above and feeding it through a roller system. The size of the sheet/bag is controlled by the speed of drawing, the feed of air into the bubble, and the temperature of the plastic. The plastic starts at a temperature that kills germs from the environment.

b. The plastic is generally not touched by workers during the manufacture. The automated machines roll the plastic, trim it to size, weld on the zipper, seal the edges, cut the individual bags from the continuous length, collate into numbered stacks, and stuff & seal the stacks into packaging. Humans generally only touch the beginning and end of the rolls of material, and since the product must be food safe, they wear gloves & probably masks. The machines have to stay food safe and are serviced with food safe products. The material itself stays protected while on the rolls by being covered by the many layers of material.

The plastic used is food safe itself. It is heated, fused, and generally untouched. As far as I know (and I could be wrong) it is much more costly to stop a non-food-safe production line, clean the line to safety standards, and start it again with food safe materials than it is to make products that are not required to be food safe with food safe materials. Almost all 3-5 gallon buckets made in the US are food safe even if not labled as such for this reason.

And as an added bonus: WD-40 is a food safe product. I would not suggest putting it on your salad, but a spritz on the manufacturing line could mean a tiny bit of mineral oil makes it onto the bag. Which if you put cold pepperoni pizza in the bag is the least of your worries.",No Slang,2025-03-17 14:51:54,2,NoStupidQuestions

"Answer: I‚Äôve never heard of it before today but I found out about it when all of a sudden all off my friends were talking about having a ‚ÄúNe Zha‚Äù watch party. We looked it up on Amazon Prime video and from the cover I just thought it was just a cheap Chinese animation movie or it was a meme or something. Watching it, I realized it was actually really really good. It tells a very compelling story about a Demon learning to defy his destiny and become a hero. The story and animation are very impressive and is onpar with Disney and Pixar (like 95% of the time)

So after watching the movie it‚Äôs pretty clear that the sequel *** must have been a crazy success in China. It‚Äôs not often that an animation of this caliber comes out and is not from a major animation studio and considering that China now has 1.411 billion people it‚Äôs not unbelievable that this movie is the most grossing animated film OAT.",No Slang,2025-03-08 04:53:21,2,OutOfTheLoop

"Dunno about you but I found the Star Citizen flight model woefully lacking compared to E:D. 

I played on a free play weekend and it was like a game that had ships modded into an FPS game rather than a bespoke space game.

Even Starfield had slightly more engaging flight models and there's bugger all to do with your spaceship.

And yeah that's kinda what I mean, I'm interested to see the new ships but they don't do anything my other 15+ don't do, and going through the engineering grind loop isn't fun enough to get me back.

Arguably the biggest issue with procedurally generated space games is there isn't enough to do, find and explore. 

I remember the early days of flying round looking for high signal strength spots and hoping they appear and then hoping it's the right encounter kind and then hoping they drop chemical manipulators not chemicals processors...

RNG drops aren't fun and engaging and grinding isn't a substitute for things to do.

That's where I want to see Frontier develop. They have hands down the best space simulator ever made with fantastic graphics, amazing ship handling and flawless sound design.

Just give me engaging things to do flying my spaceship and you have my time and my money.",No Slang,2025-03-17 18:03:00,2,gaming

"Answer: Public schools are primarily funded through property taxes. It is an inherently unequal system which gives much more funding to schools in high value districts than in poor. 

However, public schooling does allow for an ""equal"" opportunity for education, no matter the socioeconomic class of the parent. If the DOE funding ended tomorrow, those property taxes funding the public schools, in theory, would disappear. This would NOT benefit renters, or trailer owners. This would minimally benefit poor land owners. But this would greatly benefit wealthy land owners and landlords, as their children are the least likely to be attending public school in the first place... 

So, now the poor will HAVE to pay for their children's education, regardless of if they own land or can afford it, and wealthy landowners will no longer subsidize public education - which they HEAVILY rely on for the education of the skilled and unskilled labor they used to grow their wealth. 

It is just another example of passing the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class (yet again) and calling it ""freedom"" or something....",No Slang,2025-03-12 16:48:12,6,OutOfTheLoop

"Answer: For obvious reasons, security at Fort Knox is insanely tight due to the fact that something like 5,000 tons of gold are stored there, and as a result, getting the ability to actually see the gold is difficult and arduous.  This is because if you can see the gold, then you are also in the theoretical position to be able to take some of it with you, and that would be very bad.

Given that fact that almost no one can actually see the gold, there's a popular conspiracy theory that pops up every now and then that dates back at least to the 1970s that, somehow, when no one was looking, some or all of the 5,000 tons of gold at Fort Knox has actually been stolen, and people are actively working to keep that fact a secret.  This conspiracy theory hypothesizes that the actual reason almost no one can see it is because it's not there and this is all a coverup, rather than the more mundane reality that they just don't want anyone to be in a position to get their hands on the gold.

The mental image of a massive heist of thousands of tons of gold from the US Treasury is an inherently spectacular one, and as such, is exactly the sort of cool-sounding shiny distraction that captivates manchildren like Trump and Musk.  Nothing is going to come of this, I assure you.  The last time someone checked was in September of 2024.  The gold is still there.",No Slang,2025-03-04 07:02:48,155,OutOfTheLoop

"Social conservatism is often associated with maintaining or upholding traditional values and beliefs. The idea of a person changing their associated gender, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth, has always been around. But it's never been taken nearly as seriously as in recent decades, nor has it had this high of cultural acceptance. So a lot of social conservatives consider the theory of gender identity being flexible as radical, new, and not supported by science (regardless of whether that last one's true or not).

>I hear the word freedom thrown around a lot but then why constantly try to restrict these people‚Äôs freedom to be themselves or whoever they want to be when they‚Äôre not hurting anyone?

This is just a guess, but I think there may be a few overlaps here, with the backlash that same-sex marriage experienced in the late 2000's. Back then, opponents of same-sex marriage branded themselves as defenders of the institution of marriage, and that the idea of legalizing it would involve the government telling churches (that facilitate marriages) what to do. But as more states legalized it, and people realized that their marriages and churches remained the same, I think people realized how little validity these arguments had.

Similarly, I think social conservatives have a fear that legal requirements and social obligations would require people to act against their personal beliefs, when it comes to interacting with (or providing services to) trans people. Like it shouldn't matter to anyone else what letter a trans person has on their passport for ""Sex"", But people have outstanding questions about trans inclusion in gender-segregated sports teams, or how a parent can make decisions on how to help their teenager explore their gender identity without jumping the gun. And the answers to that aren't clear or universally understood yet. It's possible that fear and hate will reside once clearer answers are available to the public on how people can reconcile their disagreement with their ability to conduct themselves in social/professional interactions. But yes, it sucks that trans people are on the receiving end of bullying and discrimination in the meantime.

It's true that social conservatives support individual liberties as a traditional American value that's worth upholding, but they also tend to advocate for government regulations on those liberties **for the sake of** upholding values. Whether that's nuance, or hypocrisy, is up to personal interpretation. But they're less likely to stand by the ""let trans people do what they want, they're not hurting anyone"" stance than libertarians, who uphold individual liberties above all else.",No Slang,2025-03-09 18:56:17,5,NoStupidQuestions

But yeah this is part of it, I sometimes and in increasing amounts want to have some chill gaming without it being ""under massive time pressure since opponent is player playing by exactly same rules and in symmetrical situation where who ever does something faster and more efficiently gains edge, and then has possibility of trying to snowball from there into even stronger position, with some playroom to surprising things or spotting some weakness in opponent, as long as  you are fast enough"".

"This is a valid opinion and doesn't need changing, because it doesn't argue who's the best, just peak in an specific tournament.

Ronaldinho was great in 2006, but no 86' Maradona.

Van Basten was great in 88', but no 86' Maradona.

Messi was great from 2009-2012, but no 86' Maradona.

CR7 was great in 2017 CL, but no 86' Maradona.

The closest would be either Garrincha 62', Rom√°rio 94' or Ronaldo 02' WCs. Garrincha had to pull the weight of the team without Pel√©, but it was still an all star team with the best players of it's time, Rom√°rio's Brazil wasn't great and he hard carried them but alongside him was Bebeto who made up the best attacking duo in WC history, and Ronaldo's was an all star team that still relied heavily on him, but still, Maradona was basically hard carrying by himself.

Representatives other than Trump have raised concerns over this, including members of the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, so Trump's comments are not new, nor are they unprecedented.

There is also the notion that Zelensky has overstayed his term in office as per the Ukrainian constitution under martial law, an action that, according to political scientists, does define him as a military dictator; a position used in democracies since the Roman Republic.

The Premier League clearly doesn't suit the Brazilian play style. Bruno Guimar√£es is one of the best examples of this. He's developed and adapted perfectly to the league, but he's a tragedy whenever he steps out onto the pitch for Brazil. Whether under Tite, Fernando Diniz or Dorival Junior.

Yes, but there are cases and cases. This subreddit, with their hatred of Vinicius, say he's never played well for Brazil... But that's a lie, he was Brazil's best player at the 2022 World Cup.

Since Tite left, however, he's never managed to play well. Raphinha and Rodrygo have also played well under Tite, despite their current poor form (Raphinha is perhaps the best at the moment).

I recently played sons of the forest a bit with a friend and told him of this experience, and didn't act aggressive towards the locals when they first approached. They didn't attack me for like 45 seconds, like 8 feet in front of me and posturing like they were trying to scare me away but not actually attacking. I was like ""see?

"Do you know how your rent has gone up, groceries have gone up, electric bill has gone up?

Well, those costs have gone up for food trucks too

Food trucks are also just another business ,they are not inherently ""cheap"". If anything, sometimes their costs can be just as much as a traditional restaurant in terms of food prep. They still have to meet all health codes. They have to meet minimum wage, and be competitive with the local market. And of course they need power, gas, some type of water access for hand washing, food, supplies, refigeration, etc...

$15 for 4 tacos is $3.75. That doesn't sound that bad when you consider costs. In the US you can easily spend that much on tacos, often more like $4-5 in a sit down restaurant. Plus at sit down, you have to tip.

Your 2-3 for $5 nearly a decade ago is almost irrelevant. You might as well start talking about how a movie and a talkie used to cost a nickel. 

I don't know if this is the first time you stepped outside in 5 years, but we had a worldwide pandemic a while back. You might have heard of it.

I take that as an indication that we are still as much part of our two person team as we were when we first fell in love and married, almost 48 years ago, now.

While the exact nature of this love may well have changed over the years, given that the white hot intensity of the honeymoon phase is impossible to maintain, this is more than compensated for by our continuing to learn new things about each other.  I take loving the process of learning new things about each other as a reliable indicator that our love for each other is still growing, which makes me feel younger than my actual age whenever we are together, or even whenever I think of her.

"I've been going back and forth on this a lot, but finally decided I won't buy it.

Shadows has been a marketing and PR \*nightmare\* for an entire year. I struggle to believe it's entirely incompetence. Like, at first I thought the stuff about the resemblance of the torii gate to the one left after the WWII bombing was just typical internet conspiracy drama, but now their latest special edition stuff looks like... Chinese themed?

I love Wukong. I play Chinese gacha games. It's not about China bad. What I'm trying to say, is I'm not convinced anyone working on this game, or anyone marketing this game or running PR for this game, even knows where Japan is on a map. One of their so-called consultants is shady if not an outright fraud. Even if I try to be as charitable as possible, it doesn't explain totally failing to consult with... actual Japanese experts who aren't even remotely controversial? Who are Japanese? FROM Japan?

Compare this to how Sucker Punch developed GoT, how they marketed it, worked with real kenjutsu masters from Japan, and the difference between the baseline level of respect is night and day. There's really no excuse for Ubisoft. And not even just respect toward a people or culture, but just the effort you're putting into your product, the pride you put into your work. Why wouldn't you seek out and work as closely as possible with consultants who can help you make the best version of an alternate history game about **their** country? Why would you instead settle for a person of very dubious credibility? Rhetorically asking.

In an age where there's so much talk about ""sensitivity readers"" and the like, it is simply mindboggling how these things have happened again, and again, and again, and again with this game lol. So much of this probably could have been avoided if they'd flown a random drunk salaryman off the streets of Sapporo to their studio and showed stuff to them.

I'm a weeb, but it's not about me white knighting for Japan. I'm just convinced that Ubisoft has no effing clue what they're doing. In any way, shape, or form. They don't respect the history or the culture they're attempting to represent in their game, and they insult the intelligence of consumers, and even if you set all that aside, the game looks behind the times even when it's not glitching out. There is nothing about this game I'd feel good about financially supporting, not even for the memes; the industry must do better.

Personally i think it is a trap tho. Whenever this feeling makes you get into a relationship it is most of the time not the best. Why? Because you got into the relationship not because you wanted to in a sense, but instead because you feel like you have to take the chance. In my case i searched for someone to make me a better person , when in reality I and only I can make myself that better person.

My experience has taught me that whenever i get over that feeling - by making the best out of my life as it is with hobbies, going hiking, spending time with friends, going on holiday alone,‚Ä¶ - brought me not only the best memories of my entire life but also made me find my partner along the way. The more you express who you truly are and how you want to live, the more likely you will find someone who is exacly what you might search for - with no search needed.

Outside of that - a lot of organizations really are just blocked by their own dogma. Office politics. Red tape. We come in and suddenly all the barriers get moved out of the way. But they put the barriers in themselves. They could have done this at any time. But people are going to be people.

Both consoles are out of warranty so I'd have to pay $300 apiece to send them in to be fixed. But I've read some reports online of people not receiving their original console back or having the same issue actually up months/years later

I can suck it up and buy replacements consoles (preferably when they're on sale)

I can wait it out until the next console generation, but who knows when that will be and if they'll even have disc drives then

"This is something I discovered recently. I went back with some friends to play a more ""casual"" Valheim experience, putting 3X materials and passive enemies on.

It is indeed more casual, since we didn't *have* to fight any creatures around, only the bosses to progress our gear and biomes... but that quickly reminded me that the entire game the way it is intended to be played hinges on your encounters in the wild, combating various enemies (and of course the bosses), and spending a lot more time gathering and fighting...

That is to say, It helps to actually be using your gear and leveling your skills as you explore and obtain material for your gear upgrades, and if you wish to upgrade your base materials too. Going around without combat, and not leveling those skills; it's not as satisfying to get those gear upgrades because you're not using the gear all that much to begin with. You're cutting way down on the time spent gathering and therefore defending yourself (and basically not defending yourself at all when you put passive enemies on as we did), which of course was our goal, but then it starts feeling pointless just as you said.

"Good buddy, if all you know of sex is from porn, here are a couple of important things worth keeping in mind:

1. It‚Äôs not really all that much like porn. The positions they do in porn aren‚Äôt actually all that much fun most of the time, unless you‚Äôre putting on a show for someone (a la porn actors putting on a show for the camera). 

2. You should stop watching porn a couple months before your wedding night, maybe even from here going forward. You might find that your ol fella won‚Äôt rise to the occasion.

Also, be ready for the possibility that you or your wife might not be super into it *on* the actual wedding night. Keep in mind, both you and she have been avoiding and repressing your sexual desires *your entire life*‚Ä¶ it might not be just a switch you can flick - especially for women. She might instinctively flinch, you might flinch - there‚Äôs areas on your body that might be ticklish, you‚Äôve never been touched there by someone else and you won‚Äôt know until it happens. The headline is, don‚Äôt necessarily expect or build up the wedding night to be all fireworks and orgasms. You might find that it absolutely is that, which would be great of course, but it also might be awkward and uncomfortable and it might take a few goes before you get the real fireworks happening.

Oh lastly, if you have any intention of doing oral, shower like right beforehand.. give your penis *and* ass a thorough wash. You don‚Äôt think the ass is involved? It might not be but it‚Äôs right next door. With any luck someone will give the wife this same advice about washing. 

Anyway, this sounds all bad‚Ä¶. I dunno maybe I‚Äôm just telling you all the stuff I wish I‚Äôd been told before my first time. It‚Äôs really great though. You‚Äôre in for a treat.

Elite is still going strong, Everytime a new ace combat comes out it sells like crazy. Some people are still sucking the hopium out of Star Citizen's dead scrotum. 

The problem is more that people don't make these games. Since they're never the in Vogue game to play, developers don't realize how many people actually want to play these games. 

Elite dangerous is a case study in this. This every time fdev gets their shit together, their player base shoots right back up to Golden age levels. 

The other problem is that every game finds a niche and stays there.

If you like complete games that actually launch, Star Citizen will piss you off. X4's maps are restrictive, though it does hit like a cross between elite and the Golden age of Eve.

"Oh, you‚Äôre looking forward to me not responding? Cute. But since you went through all this effort, I‚Äôd hate to disappoint you.


1. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòfascism‚Äô‚ÄîDefine it.
Claiming news organizations are ‚Äúillegal‚Äù is obviously political rhetoric, not a legal action. If rhetoric equals fascism, then let‚Äôs talk about actual government-backed censorship through social media collusion, DHS ‚Äòdisinfo‚Äô boards, and direct suppression of dissent under previous administrations. You asked for examples? Look up the Twitter Files, the Missouri v. Biden case, and how the government leaned on tech companies to silence viewpoints they disliked.

2. Mass censorship‚ÄîDo you really want to go there?
You‚Äôre pretending that speech suppression is a one-sided issue, but the overwhelming evidence shows that mass deplatforming, corporate-government coordination, and ‚Äòdisinformation‚Äô crackdowns always lean one way. If Trump did this at the same scale, you‚Äôd be screaming about dictatorship.

3. Political prosecutions‚ÄîYou need me to spell it out?
Selective prosecution, double standards in the justice system, and the use of lawfare to silence opposition are textbook authoritarian tactics. Biden‚Äôs DOJ has done more to weaponize the courts against political enemies than anything you‚Äôre alleging Trump did. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs actual supporters were surveilled, censored, and labeled as extremists for daring to exist.

4. Forcing ideological loyalty‚ÄîYes, DEI is a cult.
Nice baiting attempt. No one is arguing against equal opportunity‚Äîwhat‚Äôs being called out is the demand for ideological conformity, where anyone questioning the dogma of ‚Äúequity‚Äù is punished. The government forcing schools and corporations to adopt ideological frameworks under the guise of ‚Äòinclusion‚Äô is the definition of compelled speech. Scrubbing DEI initiatives that actively push racial and ideological discrimination isn‚Äôt ‚Äòerasing equality,‚Äô it‚Äôs removing state-enforced propaganda.

"It's even a little more subtle than that.

Anaesthesia is a trifecta. You remove awareness, pain, and movement.

Propofol can remove awareness, but your nerve endings (and ultimately, your central nervous system) can still register pain, even if you're not consciously aware of it. Pain is a dynamic response, and left untreated, it can grow, independant of your conscious awareness.

So in addition to propofol, you will generally be given an opioid, and a local anaesthetic, to deal with pain during the intra, and peri-operative period. Even though you're not consciously aware of the pain that's being inflicted on your body, the pain is treated while you're under the effect of propofol/sevoflurane/etc, to minimize the ""residual"" pain you experience when you wake. The pain pathways (which have pathways independent of your conscious awareness) aren't given the opportunity to kick off.",No Slang,2025-03-18 10:01:02,3,funny

"Multiple issues with making her a mutated Witcher that make it a stretch:

1. Anyone who knew how to do it is dead past Witcher 3
2. A woman has never survived the poisoning
3. Geralt and/or Yennefer would have gone absolutely apeshit if she so much as hinted she'd like to try it
4. She's a lot older than your typical candidate
5. Her Elder blood is sure to be factor in how the poisons work
6. Ciri is already plenty special, different and important. Does her character really need another ""otherness"" hurdle to fight?

So to make it work they'd have to:

1. Invent someone/someway to know how to do it
2. That someone/someway needs to have a miraculous method that suddenly works on women, defying all previous knowledge
3. Ciri's ""parents"" need to be out of the picture for it
4. Take into account her powers, probably by inventing a way to remove them altogether (as they don't really work for a player controlled character anyway)

Not that it can't be done of course, you can write anything when it comes to fantasy, but it stretches the consistency of the unvierse quite a bit and seems rather forceful.

In terms of story, Ciri could (and would, imo) just as well try to be a witcher using her own skills and considerable magic powers. But then she wouldn't work well as a player controlled character and wouldn't conform to the Witcher series gameplay formula.

"We don't tip because we love giving people extra money for doing their jobs it's because food service has labor law loopholes that allow people to be paid way under minimum wage as long as they get to minimum wage in tips. Basically they make $2.something an hour and if they make no tips they get minimum wage. The only way to make more than minimum wage is through tips. Personally I would rather put money in the hands of people doing the work than letting the owner take a share so I try to tip cash. 

Why do you see tip jars next to every register and pickup window in the country? Well if everyone is handing out free money you might as well see if they'll hand it to you. Again better them than their bosses.

Atheist answers the question, providing sources and explaining why successful evolution in a social species requires a certain amount of social agreement to instill trust and ensure cooperation, and how a social species, especially one incapable of successfully surviving on their own like humans, would necessarily require a certain level of what we call ""a moral code"" to survive, explaining entirely how morality can exist without a god arbitrating it.

The next day, same theist, same sub:

""AThEisTs, iF nO gOd THeN hoW dOeS MoRaLitY EveN?""

I've worked on patients who are under conscious sedation and even from a professional standpoint, it's weird. They just lay there calmly while the doctor literally has access to your main blood vessels for stent insertion. The main one I really remember, we were able to ask the person some questions, like how is your pain, or say ""we're going to do xyz"" and they could clearly understand but couldn't really respond. I was a student in a teaching hospital at the time and the we had a student doctor doing the procedure while the watching doctor watched through the glass in the main console room. Anyways the doctor did a count for when bleeding should be stopping, and the patient didn't stop bleeding to the young doctor's shock. The experienced doctor comes over the intercom and say, ""what medications is this patient on?"" The answer was blood thinners. Once the young doctor figured that out, everything finished up smoothly, but you could tell the doctor was beginning to panic because things didn't go according to textbook.

I asked him why he was so sure her being a woman was the deciding factor if they had similar qualifications. Maybe she just interviewed better.

"To be fair, that's always been the case to an extent. Video games started off with people in their teens and early 20s getting into programming. These same people got older and matured. They're obviously no longer 20 somethings. So, unless you found a studio only comprised of young people of that generation you will always have older people trying to come up with stories for younger audiences. That's just how it is, unless you want to have some young and inexperienced writer take over a multi-million dollar franchise with barely any supervision. But maybe some conversations with actual younger team members or normal people ... not activists ... might help. It can work. We've seen it. But even younger people seem to just write this cringy shit. And have no actual imagination. Fuck me, every second game I work on has basically the same dialogue.

Praying the surgery removed everything and he won't need long term care, we find out soon. 

Also to add, I asked for the divorce because of his infidelity, an affair that I found has spanned off and on for 6 years.

"There are pros and cons.. on the one hand you have access to pretty much every single PC game ever made if you're willing to troubleshoot + download files and patches.. you have the ability to mod, enhance and just generally tailor the experience to your liking.

On the other hand hardware is expensive, and right now modern releases suffer awful performance and there isn't much you can do except throw money at it and hope you can brute force the problems away.   Then you have 3rd party launchers which are buggy and awful.. (looking at Uplay etc) 

If you're in two minds, honestly you won't be losing much by sticking to consoles if you're only interested in modern releases..  but if you're looking for games that you simply can't get on a console, older games or mods then a PC is the best call.

"That's fair, and with the amount of time spent I think it's okay for people to reach a point where the game isn't appealing anymore. While I'm not huge into it, I do know some Squadrons are quite enjoying the fact that Colonisation and Powerplay both open up new avenues to manipulate the background sim and push factional system control more, though outside of the meagre credit payouts that's not a huge boost to background sim elements actually rewarding the players taking part of it.

I'm personally of the opinion that Elite has locked themselves out of ship interiors as a feature though. At least one with any sort of proper gameplay benefit. With viewpoint changes all consistently requiring loading screens, power allocation and repairs all being done from the cockpit, and the general way the game is built, ship interiors in Elite would either be a cosmetic room that doesn't interface with the rest of the game, or require a huge chunk of reworking that would mess with how people set up their ships. At most it would be like X4, where it's a nice thing to have but mostly vestigal (though in X4 you can get an NPC to take over your vessel and handle flying while you sit down and play empire management).",No Slang,2025-03-17 12:34:38,3,gaming

"I'm glad you pointed this out. A lot of complaints on the game industry I see thrown at 'developers'. From microtransactions to delays to releases before being done. All those decisions are from way up in management and the publisher, not the lowly artists and developers doing the coding, modeling, testing.

Even more developer-adjacent complains like 'games are poorly optimized today and just require more powerful GPUs because developers are lazy now'. Again, its not so much developers are less skilled or lazy, its that games are more and more complex and publishers are pushing better graphics, ray tracing, more effects, bigger worlds, etc. and there's only so much resources and time to do it. The developers aren't making these decisions and if they are pushed to make it bigger, shinier, out the door faster, these are going to supercede optimized. It doesnt help that hardware these days makes less optimized graphics engines even possible, in the NES to PS2 era software techniques were generally ahead of software and it was possible to squeeze performance out of limited memory and raster, now with frame gen, upscaling, 24GB+ vram, fast SSDs, 300W cards, etc. possible, and the AAA sequel expected next year,  its like why even bother with some of the genius steps devs took in 90s and early 2000s to make magic happen with potato hardware, cartridges, physical discs, platter drives, minimal ram, slow clock speeds.",No Slang,2025-03-14 23:48:07,2,gaming

"I've had a few surgeries and finally learned with the last one, that waking up crying and making weird animalistic groans is the norm for me. So normal, I'm going to make sure to tell the team it happens next time lol. I think it comes from my anxiety fighting the sleep to begin with. Like everyone else said, it goes so fast but is the deepest rest I've ever felt in my life. The confusion of suddenly being awake

With my impacted wisdom teeth, I was 18 and I woke up crying so bad they had to have my mom come back early and they were so mean about it. 

Emergency surgery due to a ruptured ectopic and internal bleeding is the only one I don't fully remember waking up from. But I do remember a nurse holding my hand in the OR before. I was in so much pain... he was such a rock for me. I was ready to be knocked out for that one. Did not care. Came to terms with the fact that I might die. 

With my gallbladder, I remember coming out of it upset and hearing someone say ""go get her doctor so she recognizes someone."" And the doctor came and stroked my hand and explained it went well. My response? ""You're so young!"" Lmao meanwhile the guy next to me is asking when he can eat. So chill.

Then it happened again in 2023 for another abdominal surgery. I remember hearing the nurse bring my husband in and tell him something like ""she just started calming down."" And I started groaning and crying again and he had a giggle. He said the noises were... interesting hahah.

So yeah, that's my norm. Any other criers here?

Then, after the House voted based on that plan, Schumer abruptly announced he wouldn't block cloture. Most of the Senate Dems voted against it anyway, but ten votes supported it, despite House Dems (including Pelosi) telling them to hold the line. AOC is specifically calling him out for the last minute shift and making the rest of the party, particularly the House Minority, look like fools.


Shutdowns are always a crap shoot, and I don't even really disagree with Schumer's logic. But he and his colleagues put together a plan and he unilaterally blew it up, in public, after everybody else had already committed to it.

"Because Tesla's autopilot is a gimmick. They call it autopilot yet it's a glorified helper. It won't drive the car by itself, ever. With cameras it's impossible because it won't drive in rain or fog which is conditions found in most nations. And back in 2014 even with lidar you wouldn't really get anywhere. We are over a decade later and the autopilot Elon promised every year is nowhere to be seen.

But today it's getting possible. Back then Elon was sorta correct, it was overkill. The idea was to put lidar in all cars and then keep updating the car until it was self-driving. But that's $15K extra a car for something that does absolutely nothing yet. It was easier to call it totally useless and a waste.

Unfortunately even the people marketing it are underselling it as they are not Elon. It can see round corners which humans can't. So it can see cars that are incoming. And it looks past fog and rain. For these cars prediction is everything and you have corners in all cities. Lidar will drive way better than humans. Cameras will never see past corners.",No Slang,2025-03-18 00:09:30,7,OutOfTheLoop

It's not impossible that Tesla could change its mind and add LIDAR if it isn't so cost-prohibitive now.

4.  \*What if I fail to make it enjoyable for her?\*   

  You won't. It sounds like she loves you and yearns for you like you do for her. You might not make her come, she might not make you come, you might not be able to get hard or stay hard. It's all natural. You're still going to enjoy it because you're spending time together with someone you love, and not only that you're doing something very intimate, fun and loving. It will be enjoyable. It will also be awkward, painful (you always end up doing something like stubbing your toe and to be honest it can hurt a bit to enter a woman even if you've been going at it), stressful, uncomfortable, and all the positive words I've already used. It's going to be a lot. It's also, probably, going to be about 5 minutes or so if we go by the median. I would recommend you don't think of seggs as something with a clear start and stop - The typical ""Pen in pal is when sex"" mentality - but instead consider it something more gradual. This will help make the whole experience much more enjoyable, because you will be focused on the whole, not just one of its' parts. Flirting, sweet-talking, kissing, heavy petting, touching, caressing, fondling, hand-stuff, mouth-stuff, penetrating, more mouth stuff, more penetrating, coming, more hand-stuff, some caressing, kissing, a break, a bit of grinding, more penetrating, just holding each other, realising you're both really tired and you're not in the mood for athletics, lying down while still being inside her, holding each other tight, cuddling, etc.

"There's definitely some balancing issues that contribute to the incessant requirement for teamwork, such as the TTK and the neutering of all offensive gadgets. However, I don't think gameplay design is adequate to explain people running away from their medics. That's just sheer stupidity. It's not like they don't know I'm running medi-gun; I'll start healing and they'll proceed to jump pad out of range while they're still at 30% health, then get picked by a bloke on a rooftop before they land.

Beyond that, I've tried just following my teammates lead and supporting whatever approach they take, and that just results in both of us getting slaughtered because they play the map stupid. It's not uncommon for every team of 3 to have at least 1 player going hella negative (0-7 to 2-13), and in power shift with teams of 5 there's 2-3 useless players on each team.

My theory is that the player pool is too small for good SBMM, so I'm constantly getting paired with players that simply don't belong in my lobby.

"I liked the expansion, United Offensive, better, but CoD1 is a classic. 2 was more a let down, it looked better and was still cinematic, but the constant respawning enemies until you found the spot where they'd stop and start spawning at the next point made it meh. Still way better than newer games though. 

Online, the OG and UO were great, especially UO with some of the Base Assault maps; they were absolutely massive. Though Foy sucked to be on the Allied side since you could hit I think at least one of the bases with the 88's from across the map, maybe two of them. I also spent an inordinate amount of time on what I think was the only Retrieval server the game ever got; I played UO on that server regularly for about a decade. I'd play Base Assault if no one was on, or CTF. Rarely TDM. But they were all generally fun, I just preferred the objective-based modes over death match. 

2 was a major let down online, with much smaller maps lacking in character. Then the shotgun, which was basically broken due to the small maps, power, and accuracy at range. But they had cut the recoil on most of the weapons; a Thompson was as good as a Garand or 1903 for sniping across the maps (which were so small that the scoped and bolt action rifles were a liability). The semi-autos were also nerfed so they were lacking in damage, yet the SMGs and STG/Bren/Bar were just given less recoil and more accuracy. As a primarily rifle player, it sucked on any CoD 2 map. So I went back to 1 and UO. 

I haven't played any CoD online since 2. From videos, I've not missed anything. I did play World At War which was a major downgrade from 2 in everything but graphics. 

I remember enjoying the Gamecube games, Big Red One and Finest Hour, as well as 3, just not as much as 1/UO. I definitely think they should have been ported over.",No Slang,2025-03-13 21:33:03,14,gaming

"Well, yeah but Sonic has a whole has always verged on average. It's rare for a game to atleast reach good when the majority of the time it's average and below. Like the last time Sonic got super high praise was with Mania. A game that was a tribute to the past.

I just don't know what goes on with Sega and Sonic. It's like they are on the verge of something good, only to follow up with something meh.

Meanwhile Sonic's once competitor Mario just keeps getting hits after hits, with rarely a game getting a middling score; I don't like comparing these two, but Sega themselves has said they want Sonic to surpass Mario which at the rate they're going will never happen.

I don't want Sega to lose Sonic, but I feel like at the hands of someone else there's atleast a chance for greatness rather than always teetering on average.",No Slang,2025-03-15 15:42:17,0,gaming

"Answer: it's a newer phenomenon on twitter known as the burnerverse. Burner twitter accounts have always been a thing but they've surged in popularity ever since Elon took over and declared ""freedom of speech"" which basically means you can say and do whatever without getting banned from the site for it.

The common theme here is anonymizing by playing a character that looks clean-cut with a stock profile pic of some dude from google and a professional-sounding bio (hence the CPA/MD) while juxtaposing it with tweets that range from benign dude humor to the most dickhead shit you've ever seen targeted towards minorities....women, people of color, gay people, trans people, it doesn't matter, they'll punch down on anyone they deem lesser than, and other burners will join in. Doesn't even have to be a minority, could literally be a scrawny dude off campus that's a bit quirky, they'll sneak a photo and crack some shit about him too. The worst thing they regularly do is sneak a faceless photo of a woman they're on a date with or just slept with while she isn't looking and proceed to say the most vile shit about her, like truly evil shit that you'd probably have a hard time even imagining if you're a half-decent person.

Unsurprisingly you'll notice a lot of them have Southeastern conference schools in their bios so they're also sometimes referred to as SEC burners by others on twitter. Also unsurprisingly, if you go down the burnerverse rabbit hole around Thanksgiving/Christmas-time you'll see them posting photos from inside their parents houses, and it becomes apparent that most if not all of the guys behind these accounts come from money and silver spoon upbringing, and you can now put two and two together. That last sentence just reminded me of a tweet I saw around Christmas from a burner where he was berating his hispanic housekeeper, of course paired with a photo he snuck of her when she wasn't looking.

>Did Bezos just straight up decide to start exercising control over the paper?¬†

>Why does he want to limit the Opinions section anyway? Was there a recent opinion piece he disliked?

i don't think there was any specific recent thing, but he is basically sucking up to the new administration (which has made no bones about going after those who disagree with them) and is using the newspaper he owns to attempt to curry favor. this isn't \*that\* sudden, as he essentially forced them to not endorse a candidate in the runup to the election in November. overtly directing the news desk to cover or not cover topics, or to cover them in a specific way will a) destroy the paper's credibility and b) probably cause a mass exodus of reporters; but the editorial page is opinion and is therefore much more malleable. the editor in charge of that page decided he didn't like this policy and resigned more or less on the spot.",No Slang,2025-02-28 22:08:05,54,OutOfTheLoop

"> Nevertheless, Ukraine is getting their ass handed to them and they‚Äôre fighting a literal war of attrition.

In a war of attrition both sides suffer. Ukraine may have been already obliterated without support from the West (Europe and US). Especially from an economical standpoint, it is for the most part propped up by European funds.

Russian economy has been converted to a war economy, which still struggles to keep up with the demands of the current war and is not sustainable in the long run. Without a doubt, Europe economy as a whole is way healthier than Russian one, especially at the current rate of contribution. If the political will to support Ukraine is there, Europe can go on for many years past Russia.

Putin knows this and would most certainly like to end the war as soon as possible. Russian advance has been consistent over the past few month, but a consistent crawl.

"Once upon a time, I was against the tearing down of confederate monuments. I felt that attempts to do so were just knee-jerk reactions from out-of-touch people a thousand miles away that didn't know what sweet tea was and probably didn't wipe their feet before they entered the house, either. They were blowing everything way out of proportion, *right?* -- a bull in a china shop it had never even *seen* before but saw fit to wreck, anyway. Slavery, segregation, racism -- these were all battles we as a society fought over *decades* ago, and the good guys **won**, *decades* ago!

Slavery was abolished, of course, and what a sad stain on human history that was!

Segregation ended, thank goodness; I can't *believe* anyone thought that was a good idea, anyway.

And of course, racism has fizzled out; all the white people saw all the pain of black people and other minorities, realized the cruelty and injustice inflicted, recognized the moral arc of the universe and the trend towards greater and more universal freedom and the accompanying futility of their intolerance, and all feel *really* bad about all what happened and we're all so happy society doesn't believe in those bad things anymore!

So, ***of course*** those monuments aren't actually *celebrating* confederate soldiers or slavery and racism as a practice -- ***after all, no one actually believes in those things anymore!*** Therefore, the *only* conceivable purpose of the monuments is as a candid acknowledgement of **History**, of the mistakes of the past. Surely it's obvious we maintain these monuments as a solemn expression of virtue, of dedication to never forgetting the lows we as people were capable of! Yankees don't seem to realize it, but this is how we wear our scars on our face, so no one can claim it didn't happen, and by making sure the past isn't forgotten, we also educate our youth and protect our future! You'd actually be making racism (which pretty much died out in the 60s) *worse* by getting rid of them!

That's what I thought, anyway...

but I was also a hopelessly idealistic, naive white youngin who grew up with his home as the butt of every joke -- who grew up in a sheltered liberal home in a white neighborhood and never heard anyone say anything racist to **any** of the black people who weren't there, and just couldn't believe anyone could think anyone actually still believed that racism stuff anymore, and won't they just leave us alone and go back to mispronouncing ""pecan"" and eating that weird crappy wheat gruel that's like grits if grits were also 100x worse?

Of course, as time went on and Harambe came ever closer to becoming a meme, I saw greater evidence that, actually, some people ARE still racist peices of shit and, actually, A LOT of people are still racist pieces of shit and wait no they *actually* think the confederacy were the good guys?  Some become cops and literally step on black people's necks and other people don't just *stop* them? This guy actually thinks Obama is from Kenya? He's not just saying that to be mean?

So yeah. It was enlightening to see the rot spread out of from behind the wallpaper, and sobering to realize how much I'd hung on that wallpaper without realizing what was festering behind it all this time. If I'd had less support from thoughtful minds growing up, it's not impossible to think I might've joined that rot, earnestly believing I was in the right.

">would that mean married women who changed their last names could not vote?

Potentially, yes. Republicans in Congress introduced a federal bill that would require an exact name match between documents such as ID and a birth certificate, which will mean millions of married women run into an unnecessary obstacle when registering to vote.

The author of the bill has pointed out that the bill includes a provision that requires each state to set up an appeals process by which a married woman could show documentation to explain the name mismatch, and potentially still register to vote. This is true. However, critics of the bill still think that is an obtuse process with an undefined outcome which may still impede voter registration.

As with many things, the devil is in the details. This bill has not become law, and it could be amended to address these criticisms.",No Slang,2025-03-07 19:52:36,5,NoStupidQuestions

"Answer: This isn‚Äôt all of a sudden. The ‚ÄúRad Trad‚Äù movement has been around for years. It is a response to the currently-ailing Pope‚Äôs more liberal views. (Disclaimer: I am not a Catholic, and I don‚Äôt have a horse in this race). TikTok, et. al has given them a platform to express themselves and to make connections with other like-minded Catholics.  I would caution against the instinct to paint them all with such a broad, negative brush. They are concerned about the Church and its doctrine being co-opted or altered by societal movements and pressures. Part of what makes Catholicism what it is comes from its stalwart dogma that is resistant to change and does not (generally) move at the same speed as ever-changing cultural and societal views. Catholic theology has been established through rigorous study and debate over the course of two millennia (assuming the biblical Peter to be the first Pope). Culture is a moving target; religion is an old castle. Many trad Catholics are heavily involved in practical ministries, like feeding and clothing the needy, and some of them believe that to be the responsibility of the Church, not the State. Therefore their political opinions can vary, and often seem at odds with their religious beliefs and practices. Consider what it may have looked like if instead of a more liberal Pope, we had a recent conservative Pope. It‚Äôs conjecture, but I think we would see a liberal Catholic movement gaining similar ground on social media. There are always those who wish to preserve and those who wish to effect change.",No Slang,2025-03-03 01:21:06,3,OutOfTheLoop

Long term the NHS needs to build out it's capability to provide that care itself. That costs a lot of money and will take a potentially long time.

Doesn't help that under the tories the NHS was purposefully underfunded and private healthcare was used to patch holes while wasting even more money.

"Answer: He was recently a well-established star of Korean dramas and by some, considered to be a top talent. Recently, a young actress, who started as a child actress, but continued to work steadily, took her own life after a DUI 2 years ago. Why is this context important? Well, she was cyber bullied about her crime, public opinion took a nose dive, and basically she lost all of her endorsements and was cut from current and future projects. Two years from that, seeing no hope, she took her life (beginning of this year, sorry if the timeline's confusing).

Recently, her aunt dropped the bombshell that she and Kim Soohyun were dating when she was 15 years old and he was 27. They dated for 6 years.

It has been an onslaught of information coming out, notably that she committed suicide on his birthday. Apparently she also borrowed money from him, but because she wasn't working, couldn't pay it back (upwards of $500,000 in USD). He was apparently suing her to get it back, the agency that he owns was also representing her, and her aunt believes that the agency did not do enough to protect her niece.

Obviously, brands do not want to be associated with that and he was dropped. There's more coming out, but none of the details get any better. Korea has a history of celebrities being harassed by netizens, made even more convoluted by the fact that some celebrities are actually committing crimes or being awful people.

Netizens don't discriminate and go after the innocent and guilty alike. I'm not an expert, but I believe 15 is the age of consent in Korea, but that's based off of a comment I read elsewhere so I'm not sure how true that is. REGARDLESS, a 27 year old man dating a 15 year old girl is disgusting and abhorrent behavior. In the beginning I was a bit suspicious because the aunt came out with the info months after her niece's passing, thinking it was some weird blackmail attempt.

Photos came out and texts, so I guess it's true. Enough damage has been done to his image anyway that Prada has dropped him and I'm sure more endorsements are to follow.",No Slang,2025-03-14 21:09:52,553,OutOfTheLoop

"Answer: Get used to it. As people age, some of them lose their mental capacity and have to be cared for by family, professionals, or a combination of both. And nobody agrees on what ""proper"" elder care looks like, especially for someone who is rich and famous. So there will always be outsiders looking in at care plans, not fully understanding the ever-changing nature of caring for elders - especially those in mental decline - and will accuse the caretakers of not doing it ""right"", despite there being no ""right"" answers.

This is going to be in the news cycle for the rest of our lives. Start ignoring it now, and save your sanity. (Or hey, get into elder care and learn how complex it actually is.)

Similar in that a vaguely-defined ideology is being portrayed as anti-American, and the government is making wide-sweeping efforts to halt any federal funding for anything that even remotely resembles it. Also, some federal workers whose jobs are related to DEI have been lost.

Different in that there has not yet been a witch hunt, where influential figures' allegiances or affiliations are being questioned.

"Is there actually a lot of support for the presidents hardline stance on Ukraine? I live in the UK, and I‚Äôm absolutely dumbfounded by what I‚Äôve read, to the point where I‚Äôm actually starting to question if any of it‚Äôs true or just the media we‚Äôre being fed. Some of the takeaways from what I‚Äôve read that I don‚Äôt get:

1) the Ukraine ‚Äúwar‚Äù - it keeps getting framed as if Americans are cross at Zelenskyy for keeping a war going that he can‚Äôt win whilst begging everyone else to pay for it. Is it not well understood that that Ukraine was **invaded**? They didn‚Äôt start a war, they were attacked, their land seized and millions of their people displaced. Their only options were fight or be assimilated. He‚Äôs definitely pleaded for help and resources but I don‚Äôt exactly blame him!

2) Zelenskyy is a dictator - were ya‚Äôll really buying that he was a dictator that ‚Äúrefused‚Äù to hold elections? Surely nobody actually expects his to hold an election? It‚Äôs not like he can go out and campaign, his country is a war zone. America had an election whilst *at war* but the war wasn‚Äôt on American soil, nor was it under occupation, it was a bit different. Ignore all this and you‚Äôre still trusting the Russians not to rig it!!

3) The war is costing America billions - there‚Äôs an underlying argument that the money would be better spent elsewhere, and even that Zelenskyy is embezzling it, and people want a paper trail to prove he‚Äôs not misusing funds. This one I guess I understand to a point, it does cost a lot to support Ukraine with little return. What I don‚Äôt get tho, do people actually believe America is bankrolling them? Like literally sending big duffel bags of cash? Weapons and arms, sure, but is there actually people who think Zelenskyy is just stealing money from you?

4) Zelenskyy needs to concede - again, similar to the first point, there seems to be a argument that Zelenskyy is prolonging the war and he‚Äôs to blame for the lack of progress in peace negotiations. Putin is not stupid, he‚Äôs currently camped on a lot of the ground he wanted to annex from Ukraine. Conceding now is basically just giving him a lot of what he wanted to begin with, whilst Ukraine loses a bunch of its land and resources. I get the feeling the role Zelenskyy has in this war is being majorly misconstrued to the American people.

5) the pro-Russian collective - Is this really a thing now? I think I get why your administration is pals with Putin, an oligarchy probably appeals to Trump. What I don‚Äôt get is why his supporters are suddenly alright with this? You guys are famously anti-Russian, now you‚Äôre cowing to them?

"ANSWER: Karla Sofia Gascon starred in *Emilia Perez,* a musical about a Mexican cartel boss who transitions. Gascon was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress in a Leading Role, making her the first openly trans actor to be nominated for an Oscar, and she was getting some buzz as a potential winner. Her campaign got derailed when some of her old tweets resurfaced, including one where she called Islam an ""infection for humanity that urgently needs to be cured.""

Usually when a celeb runs into a controversy like this they'll consult with a PR team and follow their instructions to minimize damage. Gascon put out a standard statement right after the tweets resurfaced just like you would expect. Then... she kinda did her own thing. She put out statements without running them by her team. She went on Instagram to try and clarify things without running the plan by her team. She did an interview with the Spanish-language arm of CNN and insisted she didn't do anything wrong, again without running it by her team. None of it made her look better.

In short, she went against her publicists' advice and, in doing so, dug herself in a deeper and deeper hole. That was what Conan's joke was about.

It's a impressive museum, very well curated and covers all aspects of the slave trade to the Americas. It has a slavery timeline on one of the walls that covers 400 years or so of that history and notes 1964 as being ""The end of slavery in the United States"". Not 1864, but 1964.

Especially with dialogue where I can see three things I wanna say, pick one, and the other 2 aren't an option once that line is finished.

Btw kcd and kcd2 are utterly brilliant.

The study tested the performance of baseline athletic standards such as push ups sit ups and csrdio as well as reading muscle atrophy and rehab levels and times

"Answer: ETA is a recently formed nonprofit. It started when individuals with backgrounds in stats and data analytics saw the statistical impracticalities that surrounded the election like winning all 7 swing states outside of recount margins as well as other irregularities. Their information is based on publicly available data. If you are a statistician or data analyst you can recreate the charts yourself and come to your own conclusions.

Basically what they are doing is election forensics. Real election ""rigging"" or ""manipulation"" does take place in democracies world wide however it has become extremely sophisticated and incredibly hard to detect.¬†[Due to this USAID developed a tool](https://www.iie.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/UM-Election-Forensics-Guide-FINAL.pdf)¬†to help detect election data anomalies in other countries. It uses stats and data analytics as well. Personally, I have wondered why election forensics is not done here in the US. There are universities that study it but it doesn't seem to impact our elections nor is it talked about in the media.

ETA started with Nevada because they provide the public with the most detailed information on their elections that many other jurisdictions leave out. They made a press release about Pennsylvania and it is on their website as well. They also discuss more in their videos than what they have published on their websites. It takes a while to verify and analyze data. It would not make sense for them to rush and publish information quickly without making sure it is accurate first. More states will be coming out shortly.

They have collaborated with¬†[smartelection](https://smartelections.us/)s a non-profit with a well established history. In one of their¬†[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOQ-GxJyJN4)s they speak with a chief statistician,¬†[Dr. Elizabeth Clarkson](http://bethclarkson.com/)¬†who found similar irregularities in the¬†[2004 election.](https://www.emporiagazette.com/latest_news_and_features/article_046afc80-d2cb-5f8e-9ced-5798245f7303.html)

I can empathize with how people who don't like heat feel in summer since I've kind of felt it before. When I was on SSRIs, I had the common side effect of being more affected by the heat and UV rays. During that time, I actually did lose some of my heat tolerance, so I can empathize with people who don't do well even more than before since I sort of get it now.

Cena would go on to win this match tonight.


The other half of this is WWE Champion Cody Rhodes and The Rock. Rock told Cody to become his corporate Chsmpion and sell his soul to him. Rock wanted Cody's answer tonight.

I've basically given up that if there's ever a situation where I need pain/sedation, I'm just never going to get enough to touch it b/c docs don't want to ""overmedicate"" (or kill) their patients. So stuff just hurts & I'm just awake. Except propofol. Prop induction will get me down.

If they try making a remake or a sequel, they could try keeping a similar artstyle to Dragon quest since both are originally designed by Akira Toriyama, although I think Dragon quest has a slight more childish/colorful artstyle than Chrono Trigger. 

Or maybe got for a FF7R treatment, personally I would love this because I loved both FF7R.

"Answer: Everything u/faceintheblue said about Ukraine not having an election since the war began and not being able to have one while the war continues is correct, but I want to offer one very critical addendum: Ukraine's people cannot vote right now, but its parliament who represent them can. In the wake of Trump's ridiculous claim that he was a dictator, parliament held a vote to determine if Zelensky should remain president.

The vote was 268 in favor. Zero opposed. Ukraine's parliament is not a single unified party.

Additionally, Zelensky has offered to step down in exchange for protection from Russian aggression via any of a number of means to achieve it, such as NATO membership or a peacekeeping force or other mutual defense treaty.

Say you have a region of exactly 100,000 Democrats and 100,000 Republicans. You want to know the opinion of those Ds and Rs in that region, but you want to maybe slant it in your views favors. So you choose to have 100 people polled, and you'll extrapolate from that, but skew it so that you favor one side over the other. So you poll 70 Democrats and 30 Republicans. Say you ask them if they favored X, Y, and Z yet only 5 Democrats say YAY and 28 Republicans say YAY. Well 28/30 is 93% of the Republicans while 5/70 is only 7% of the Democrats.

"EDIT: Hey! I tried to write out a thoughtful reply, but I just cannot post it.  
I've got no idea what part of my text isn't allowed to be posted, I tried to make it all twee and it still didn't go. I'm gonna edit this comment and see what part gives me the time-out. For some reason the advice-stasi are very fickle and what is allowed at one point then isn't allowed at a later time. Also I am allowed to post point 3 and 4 as responses to my comment? It's odd. I'm sorry that has made the formatting terrible.  

  
I'm going to go a little bit into my own first time experience, which will be very different from yours. And then I'll try to answer these questions you asked:

\> *What does it actually feel like? What if I don‚Äôt know what to do? What if I fumble or make mistakes? What if I fail to make it enjoyable for her?*  

*Anyway, my first time:* I lost my virginity at 16 to a girl who had just broken up with her boyfriend. She had big boobs, so I liked her. She wanted us to be FWB because she found me attractive, even though I was a virgin. Or at least that's what she said, but then we only had seggs the one time. There were people in the room next door, just other teenagers, but still. I'm sure they could hear us.  

She turned on moodlight and put on some music. As soon as she took off her shirt I was on her like a dog. Slobbering her face, hands going everywhere. Our teeth knocked into eachother a few times. I tried to bite her lip, because I heard that was sexy, she laughed and I felt stupid. Eventually I got enough courage to put my hand down her pants. It was way lower than I thought it would be. I put on a con-dome myself and felt proud I knew how to do that. I don't remember much else. It wasn't anything special I think, it was short that much I do know. I climbed out a window afterwards, so it would remain a secret. We didn't really talk after that, she ghosted me kinda. Which would become a pattern in partners and something I kinda had to deal with and still do. I sort of expected that situation would occur, but was fine with it because I wanted to get my first time ""over with"". I thought it would make sex easier afterwards, but I don't think it really did matter much. It took years before I had a healthy relationship with it and it wasn't like the subsequent times were less awkward. It removed some of the mystique, which I am happy for. It was nice to finally know what sex felt like, though I didn't really know, because sex feels like a lot of things and what it feels like one day will be way different than another day.  

So I don't know how it will feel to do any of those things for the first time, since I don't really remember them. Maybe you won't either, though I really doubt it. Take your time, don't stress, you don't have to get it over with. Try to have fun.  

**Now your questions**

  
1. *What does it actually feel like?*  

In one way it's easy to explain. It's just a combination of many simultaneous sensations. You're hugging someone you appreciate deeply tight. You're stimulating your erognous zones. You're having an orc-chasm (though often more intense than one brought on all by yourself). You're looking at something nice. You're hearing moans (and a lot of other sounds). You're touching something soft. You're tracing your lovers body. That's about it. Pretty easy to describe.  

But the whole is more than the sum of its' parts and describing what it is actually like is a lot more difficult. I like to think of it as engaging in several types of conversations at once - The flirtateous, the daring, the joking, the sweet loving, the at-time apologetic, it is often awkward (which is why a sense of humor is great!) I dunno, it's the best I can do for you.    
  
2. *What if I don't know what to do?*  
You won't. It's okay, why would you know? How could you know? Talk to each other. Coitus isn't some solemn hymn where anything except the blessed words of whichever verse you're on is to be uttered. It's something fun to do with your lover, and it's much more fun if you're on the same page - like the rest of the relationship really. Communication is key! She also won't know what to do, that's part of the fun of it (though it's more fun when you're more experienced. First time is a trial.) With every partner I've been with I've made mistakes, be they one-time-flings or years of passion. You work things out together and what works one time might not work another. 
  
I assume you've been told this before and it's really more of a question of ""how do I talk?"" Which there isn't one golden rule of either, but there are guidelines. Tell your partner when you like things, kiss their neck and whisper what they're doing to you that is nice in the moment. 
Something like *I love it when you caress my back*. Ask you partner if they like what you're doing too, sort of like *do you like it when I grab your ass like this?* You can also ask more open-ended questions, but let it be part of a ""game"" of sorts: ""I love touching you, I love feeling your beautiful body. Where do you want me to touch you?"" is  oftentimes better than ""where do you like to be touched?""And talk about what you did after the fact too. You can be more candid and less flirty at that point because you don't have to maintain ""the conversation"". Lying in bed after a good time, tracing your lovers body, staring into the ceiling... Perfect time to say something out of the blue like ""I really liked it when you pulled my hair."" And set boundaries too, there's nothing worse than being with someone who cannot vocalise their needs! Being told ""I don't enjoy oral"" is so much nicer than thinking you're doing something nice while she's really just waiting for it to be over.  
  


**For more unwanted tips:**  
Foreplay is part of sex and it is great fun! Fingering is great fun too. When fingering your partner don't just thrust your fingers straight in and out - Do a curved motion instead, thus hitting the g-spot.   

While being in missionary position place a pillow under your partners behind. This makes it so you're hitting her g-spot too.  

Learn what the clitoris is and what it does for her. Some women like you to be on it like a DJ, others want you to touch it at specific times, others at no times.  

People moan in different ways. They react to sexual stimuli in different ways. Your partner might not have a ""typical"" reaction. (assuming you have some idea of what ""typical"" might be, could be from hollywood movies or whatever. Sex is everywhere in popular culture). That doesn't make it less valid though, and trust your partner if she doesn't and she tells you she does.  

Moan in her ear.  

It really isn't about cumming. I'm a guy and I'm on anti-depressants so it's pretty hard for me to come. Doing the deed is still great. It's fun! It's intimate! It's nice! It's so many good things! If you make it about coming then it will be harder to come. You might also risk that she feels she ""has to"" come in order to satisfy you, and so she starts faking and oh my god you do not want that.",No Slang,2025-03-17 23:03:28,1,NoStupidQuestions

Literally none of them. Some people may have anecdotally called them that in various forums or political discourse, but they were never charged that way.

"Sounds like the concept of the ""corporate veil"" which is a good thing in many cases. It separates a business owner's private assets from the business assets. If you own a restaurant and the restaurant goes bankrupt while it still has debts, then the debtors aren't allowed to go after your private assets like forcing you to sell your house or car. This is generally a good thing.

I don't know at all what the deal was with Joann, but here is one possible set-up: There could be some kind of licensing fee for brand usage. For example, the parent company could own the IP rights for Joann Fabric, and would then license it to a toootally, definitely, take-my-word, pinky-promise, definitely independently run company that just so happens to actually own/operate/manage Joann stores (and which also happens to accrue all the debt).

Now, it's possible for owners to be so egregious with companies that the legal authorities decide they aren't actually separate entities. This is called ""piercing the corporate veil"". For example, if that restaurant owner didn't have a separate bank account for the restaurant, or if they took money out of the restaurant's bank account for personal things like mortgage payments or a vacation or something, then you can tell that the business and owner aren't really operating as separate entities. 

I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, and I have no proof that any such set up was used. This is just a hypothetical about how separation between a business and its owner may work, and how that's not necessarily a bad thing. You don't necessarily want to ruin a business owner's whole life just because the business failed. We're more sympathetic in the case of mom 'n' pop shops, but the basic principle is the same.

There are of course other ways to extract wealth from businesses. Being an executive and receiving extreme pay. Being a shareholder and receiving dividends. Lending money to the business at a significant interest rate. The list goes on and on. I'm sure that many of these would be thrown out as illegal (or as fake ploys to avoid financial responsibility) if push came to shove, and if it was obviously not in good faith.",No Slang,2025-03-16 01:15:09,1,OutOfTheLoop

Starfield for a couple hours until its bad.
