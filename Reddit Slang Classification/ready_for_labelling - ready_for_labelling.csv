starbucks has also been losing money and theres been a general trend since the pandemic of price increases you had a lot of good stuff in your answer but i wanted to clarify one point starbucks isnt losing money in q they made had a net revenue of million or cents per share which is down from billion or per share a year earlier the issue is the declining revenue despite growing the number of stores by net new stores in q ending the period with stores and a increase in average ticket the end result is they are going to reward their stockholders by passing on costscharging their customers more their goal is by increasing net revenue that it will also increase the stock price,OutOfTheLoop,No Slang

answer public schools are primarily funded through property taxes it is an inherently unequal system which gives much more funding to schools in high value districts than in poor however public schooling does allow for an equal opportunity for education no matter the socioeconomic class of the parent if the doe funding ended tomorrow those property taxes funding the public schools in theory would disappear this would not benefit renters or trailer owners this would minimally benefit poor land owners but this would greatly benefit wealthy land owners and landlords as their children are the least likely to be attending public school in the first place so now the poor will have to pay for their childrens education regardless of if they own land or can afford it and wealthy landowners will no longer subsidize public education which they heavily rely on for the education of the skilled and unskilled labor they used to grow their wealth it is just another example of passing the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class yet again and calling it freedom or something,OutOfTheLoop,No Slang

there are pros and cons on the one hand you have access to pretty much every single pc game ever made if youre willing to troubleshoot download files and patches you have the ability to mod enhance and just generally tailor the experience to your liking on the other hand hardware is expensive and right now modern releases suffer awful performance and there isnt much you can do except throw money at it and hope you can brute force the problems away then you have rd party launchers which are buggy and awful looking at uplay etc if youre in two minds honestly you wont be losing much by sticking to consoles if youre only interested in modern releases but if youre looking for games that you simply cant get on a console older games or mods then a pc is the best call sometimes i miss the ease of use of a console but i do love the freedom of a pc,gaming,No Slang
