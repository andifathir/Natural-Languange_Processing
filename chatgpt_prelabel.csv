if anything a year deal actually protects his value more this line is completely wrong if youre not specifying offering a longer deal in exchange for lower wage demands the downside of having a washed player on k per week is much higher than maybe having to negotiate again in or years saudi is already at a somewhat of a saturation point with almost all teams having fille their foreign player slots meaning they now have to sell before buying and their players might be hard to move given inflated wages all this also assumes that salah will accept going to saudi and even if he is willing to go unless the fee is sizeable there is likely no benefit for him being contracted for longer rather than just renegotiating making a very risky financial decision based on trusting someone will be there to bail you out is not a good way to run a football club especially when the world is entering a turbulent economic environment,soccer,Internet Slang

this varies by restaurant so there is no one right answer but at restaurants that prioritize drivethru at the expense of everything else they let the counter orders languish until there is a lull in drive through work to be done so its either a wash or its faster to just go drive through even for app orders if its a place that you can order ahead of actually arriving and where they will just place your order on a shelf unattended then going inside can be faster and your food will likely be cold but if its mcdonalds where they wont make your online order until gps confirms you are at the restaurant going inside is rolling the dice mcdonalds gives extreme priority to keeping the drivethru line moving,funny,No Slang
