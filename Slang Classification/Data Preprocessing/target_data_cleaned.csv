i think youre overthinking it i hold with the school of thought that emotions are physiological studies have shown that we unconsciously mix up emotions with similar physical reactions for example sweaty palms and a racing pulse due to something like fear from being on a rollercoaster may be conflated with attraction to the person you happened to be on the rollercoaster with the idea is that we have the physical reaction and then our brains fill in the emotion causing it and those reactions are basic reward and punishment we feel tenderness when looking at a baby because thats evolutions way of motivating us to take care of our young dogs and cats show similar instincts really theres no evolutionary reason for emotions except to motivate us to do or not do things and various animals have demonstrated that they also run on this basic system,No Slang,NoStupidQuestions,851

this varies by restaurant so there is no one right answer but at restaurants that prioritize drivethru at the expense of everything else they let the counter orders languish until there is a lull in drive through work to be done so its either a wash or its faster to just go drive through even for app orders if its a place that you can order ahead of actually arriving and where they will just place your order on a shelf unattended then going inside can be faster and your food will likely be cold but if its mcdonalds where they wont make your online order until gps confirms you are at the restaurant going inside is rolling the dice mcdonalds gives extreme priority to keeping the drivethru line moving,No Slang,funny,707

i generally trust aoc but to attempt to steelman schumers argument before we go ballistic my basic understanding is that during a shutdown the executive branch has the ultimate say in what and who is essential and may continue to operate given that social security checks are in jeopardy already a shutdown would give them cover as to who caused ss to break and also they can deem all the courts in which we have them on the ropes nonessential as well things like that are what we may have avoided by taking this path that said i heard aoc say that the senate and house had a plan and that schumer backed out of it i want to know what the totality of that plan was if it would have brought them to the negotiating table and given us a clean cr without the partisan crap the rs injected of course that is better in every way,No Slang,OutOfTheLoop,823

the last resort for ukraine would be to continue to fight the russians alone without a deal and without the support of the us thats not only without weapons and cash but also intelligence which has been crucial for air defence thats a losing war for them so if trump says make a deal or we quit zelenskyy has to at least pretend to engage with the process to avoid that scenario on the other hand a negotiated settlement with formal americanbacked security guarantees is one of the best possible outcomes for ukraine since it would guarantee military strength and prevent a future invasion thats why the ukrainian negotiators have been reiterating it as one of their red lines along with de jure territorial integrity and sovereignty it might not be enough to get the russians to agree but it might be enough to convince the americans they are serious about the process,No Slang,OutOfTheLoop,869
