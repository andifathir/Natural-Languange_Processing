And humans in general are really bad at choosing long term collective good over short term individual gain (news flash: most humans are inherently selfish creatures), so sometimes you need to force their hand for the greater good.

" I get what Hong Myung-bo is saying. We‚Äôve been hearing about Minjae‚Äôs Achilles for months now it seems like. But I mean the player always has an opinion on this too and obviously players always want to play. Kim clearly felt like he could play so he played. Over the past couple weeks or so Minjae had I think 2 instances where he didn‚Äôt start a game and Eric Dier came in (and played well too) but then Upamecano got hurt so Minjae stepped in again. 

I think at first Kompany was hesitant to play Dier because he‚Äôs definitely lacking the pace of Kim and Upa but Dier is so good with his positioning and ball playing that he‚Äôs figured out how to mitigate his lack of pace issues. So yeah, Dier has started to play a bit more recently as the 3rd option to rotate either of Kim and Upa but this only recently started happening. 

Ultimately tho Kim has decided to keep playing. He got ‚Äúrest‚Äù from practice time to time and I‚Äôm sure the medical staff was monitoring him closely. While I understand the frustration of Korea, I just think it really came down to Kim wanting to push through.

"One thing found with Layden, he talks a lot of things contradictory to what he did. He talks about rising budgets and unsustainability yet, he was one of the executives who pushed the path they were on. His quote "" fewer but bigger"" is exactly what was wrong with Sony's lineup of titles that it took Jim Ryan to push indies focus back into PlayStation. At some point his insights become worthless. 

Also generally about Sony's titles, budgets and purpose of consoles and talk about sustainability, I think people tend to forget that most of their business revenue and profits don't revolve around first party titles. First party only accounted for 10% of all software sales last quarter including their ports.  Their biggest profits has always been being a platform whether that be third party sales, MTX, subs and this generation has been the most profitable Sony has ever been. Reason why they haven't fully committed like MS has regards to porting is same reason why they didn't fully drop titles on subscriptions when MS was doing the same and there was immense pressure to do so, potential long term damage. We saw how Sony tested Horizon on PS plus a year later and it devastated it's sales and then they never did a year release on subs since. There used to be a time when they had the mindset that titles drove platform uniqueness and made all sorts of title. Think every generation they've literally lost parts of that identity remains to be seen if they turn it around. Think they better act much faster than they're doing because Steam is now overtaking PlayStation as place where people buy third party sales too. Honestly reading the interview Layden sounds like an former executive who has literally no ounce of competitive drive (failing to see how Nintendo/Steam are direct competitors at this point) and would roll over as soon as stronger competition comes through (which is kind of happening now) rather than looking at understanding why the brand is losing relevancy, how they can go about improving the platform experience. (honestly there's a lot to improve on especially as things are shifting towards digital and I know where I'd trust my purchases more and it's not on PS).",No Slang,2025-03-16 20:36:58,gaming

"Answer: There are a few reasons people are hating on it, ranging from reasonable to racist.

Probably the loudest group of people are upset at the casting of Rachel Zegler, who is Latina, as Snow White.  The most charitable reading of this is that in the original fairytale, Snow White is described as having ""skin as white as Snow"".  The less charitable assessment is of this is that a large group of the people upset about it are being racist, and probably wouldn't have raised a stink about it if a white woman of European descent had been cast, though if you really wanted to be 100% accurate to the original Grimm tale you'd have to hire someone with albinism, cake them in powder and dye their hair black.

A smaller group is probably upset over the casting of Gal Gadot as the wicked queen for a couple reasons.  The most negligible of these is criticism of her acting, but a stronger one is her vociferous support of Israel's recent bombing campaign and treatment of Palestinians.

A third possible reason is the weird back and forth on how they're handling the seven dwarves, with the use of widely ridiculed CGI creations that most people agree are incredibly off-putting.

And finally, plenty are just tired of the factory-like churn of Disney remaking their classic animated hits as live action/realistic CGI at a pace that makes them feel like soulless cash grabs.",No Slang,2025-03-16 15:15:44,OutOfTheLoop

"I think you're overthinking it. I hold with the school of thought that emotions are physiological. Studies have shown that we unconsciously mix up emotions with similar physical reactions. For example, sweaty palms and a racing pulse due to something like fear from being on a rollercoaster may be conflated with attraction to the person you happened to be on the rollercoaster with. The idea is that we have the physical reaction and *then* our brains fill in the emotion causing it.

And those reactions are basic reward and punishment. We feel tenderness when looking at a baby because that's evolution's way of motivating us to take care of our young. Dogs and cats show similar instincts. Really, there's no evolutionary reason for emotions except to motivate us to do or not do things.

The articles premise is that Trump wants some kind of global economic reordering, by use of the so called mar-a-lago accord.

I was expecting something about it happening pre written record, it‚Äôs one of the mysteries god left for us to figure out, something compatible with what I knew to be fact. Nope.

However, I don‚Äôt understand why this has been happening for years and how it gets so incredibly dry.

I asked my partner if he‚Äôs experienced anything similar or if he‚Äôs aware of this issue. He‚Äôs never heard of anything like it and hardly ever needs to use lotion himself.

"it‚Äôs like when someone says they got x iphone pro so they can play genshin at a slightly higher frame rate and they say they‚Äôre a hardcore gamer the same as you are on the top of your pc pile. it‚Äôs like the top of a tiny mole hill when there‚Äôs a bigger hill right next to it called console gaming and then the bigger hill next to that called pc gaming. it‚Äôs one of the difficulties in using a generic term like ‚Äúhardcore gamer‚Äù because it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean the same thing to everyone. 

don‚Äôt get me wrong, i‚Äôm just trying to explain what they are probably imagining and it‚Äôs not really incorrect as far as performance/customization goes. consoles are undeniably more accessible and standardized than pcs which have significantly higher top end. this is neither good nor bad, but if someone labels hardcore as wanting the highest performance from your potential machines vs passion and investment they are going to see everything but the top half of the pc pile differently. 

also and this isn‚Äôt a critique of you, but i think it hurt your argument focusing on the console type and nice tv factor instead of the 30 years of gaming. like if instead of ‚Äúi bought a nice af tv so i am gamer‚Äù you said ‚Äúi beat x game 100%‚Äù or ‚Äúi have x hours on x game‚Äù or ‚Äúi play fighting games competitively‚Äù then it‚Äôd be less easy to read as ‚Äúoh i invested a lot of money so im hardcore‚Äù and more ‚Äúim hardcore so i invested‚Äù. hope that makes sense.",No Slang,2025-03-16 19:30:37,gaming

"Read the article.

It's pretty much explained there that publishers started spending a lot of money on content (graphics, effects, 100 hours of gameplay) and so they need a lot of sales with expensive development. Because of this, games are released everywhere.

And we don't get a lot of sales because

1. Game services are at the top of the profits
2. Point 1 forces game studios to make games with big budgets and refuse exclusives, releasing games everywhere.

I think it's a paradox in a way. As long as gamers are spending a lot of money on session games, single player games and creativity at big studios will suffer. We're going through the 80s in a new form right now, only back then everyone was making bad quality games, which led to the crash.

( Counting trans men it would be seven ) This includes a guy who said hi to me a few times and held the door open for me. So no, I don't have high standards. Pretty sure one of them had two girlfriends.  ( Nice to me not to thee. ) And one of those girlfriends was always shooting me dirty looks so maybe she at least thought he was trying to get with me. One I sit with awkwardly in class and he doesn't insult me and has said hi to me a few times so I count him. There are some more men but they said such awful things about our teachers I won't even add them to the count. 

I live in a blue state. 

Please don't blame me when I'm a little more unsure of men than women as my number for women past middle school being nicer would be much larger. My number for men hurting me vs women hurting me would be much larger as well. Maybe when I get past highschool this prejudice won't be as needed but school boys at least are majority awful from what I've seen, met, heard, realized. 

Group of boys in my middle would talk about gang b/nging the teachers women or man. Two/three harassed me. My p.e teacher assaulted me and the guys who harassed me called me a liar when I came out about it. Changed middle schools. The first day a guy came up to me, told me to look to my side, then grabbed my face and turned it towards him then walked away. 

I've been asked 'What color is it? is it pink?' 'Want to get with my friend?' ( I was having a breakdown about whether or not I want to go back into a mental hospital, didn't know those guys, they asked it will walking past, not the goddamn time. ) 'Hey my friend likes you!' yeah thanks I know that it should be considered an insult to have any feelings or care for me! 

'Yeah [ my name ] is my girlfriend.' I am not. Was not. Never will be. 'Hey what do you think about my friend?' 'Hes weird I don't know him and he keeps calling me his girlfriend.' I felt bad for being too harsh in front of everyone.  *the guy kept calling me his girlfriend after that so I guess not harsh enough though.* 

I don't think I have that heavy of a prejudice when I'm actually faced towards a guy in person, unfortunately.
 But please don't blame other girls/women for having one it would probably benefit me greatly if I did and girls/women don't owe men/boys compliance and to be gentle and polite and considerate when treated with the opposite behavior repeatedly. 

I've been whistled at in the halls or during p.e. Called a 'mommy' by a stranger. 

The prejudice I do have is fear based on being treated like I have been again. Which I most surely will be treated like again.",No Slang,2025-03-18 19:26:48,teenagers

If we can‚Äôt have government healthcare, then I would like it to be really easy to compare each company‚Äôs takes, so we buy insurance from the companies that pay out the most and so insurance companies compete to keep that margin thin.

But more importantly, why are the bills so high in the first place? A 17% reduction in healthcare costs won‚Äôt get us anywhere near the costs people pay in Korea even when they don‚Äôt have insurance. Hospitals and pharma companies are charging too much.

National Monuments are supposed to be ‚Äòthe smallest area necessary for their purpose‚Äô this is unique to nat monuments. Trump is reducing their size using that framework. Presidents create national monuments via executive order so presidents can also reduce their size or get rid of them. National Parks are created by acts of congress and therefore need an act of congress to get rid of them. All of this to say though, our parks are incredibly vulnerable. Even more so our national forests as they are multiple use and can be essentially pillaged for profitable resources. 

We have fought so hard for sustainable management and we have so much more work to do, but a privileged few seem to have decided they‚Äôd rather rape the land for nothing but greed and immediate personal financial gain than try to usher in a better future. We need to fight for these wildlands. They will disappear faster than can be comprehended if we don‚Äôt and we will never see them again. Why can they do all of this?

The left needs to learn how to protest in ways that the right can't infiltrate with bad actors that justify use of force. 

Better yet. Don't go to physical protests. They dont accomplish much anymore. 

In the past, it was a demonstration that people were willing to get off their butts and use a day up to make sure they're heard. This theoretically could translate to votes on election day.

Your most reasonable expectation is to look past people's tone and how mean they are being and see if they are saying anything of value about the topic you are asking about",No Slang,2025-03-18 18:48:22,NoStupidQuestions

"Answer: It is controversial bc its not well understood and the waters are being muddied by peoples emotional feelings towards Trump/Palestine/Israel. Many people who are upset about this view it as an infringement on freedom of speech and due process. Additionally, the way he was detained was unusual and caused some to believe this is a gestapo style detainment.

Mahmoud is a greencard holder which is a privilege not a right and like any other privilege it can be revoked with or without reason at any time prior to naturalization. A greencard holder does not have the same rights and protections as an American citizen. Committing crimes is the easiest way to lose this status. In the event the federal government decides to revoke green card status, it would be ICE who would be responsible for detaining the greencard holder and this would happen without a warrant or due process.

Contrary to popular belief, freedom of speech is not unlimited. It is a federal crime in the US to provide resources or support for any designated terrorist organization. In this case, HAMAS has been designated as a terrorist organization since 1997 and Mahmoud was on video chanting support for them and screaming ""death to America"".
