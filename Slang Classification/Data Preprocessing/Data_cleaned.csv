this varies by restaurant so there is no one right answer but at restaurants that prioritize drivethru at the expense of everything else they let the counter orders languish until there is a lull in drive through work to be done so its either a wash or its faster to just go drive through even for app orders if its a place that you can order ahead of actually arriving and where they will just place your order on a shelf unattended then going inside can be faster and your food will likely be cold but if its mcdonalds where they wont make your online order until gps confirms you are at the restaurant going inside is rolling the dice mcdonalds gives extreme priority to keeping the drivethru line moving,No Slang,funny
