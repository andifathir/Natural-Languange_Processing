starbucks has also been losing money and theres been a general trend since the pandemic of price increases you had a lot of good stuff in your answer but i wanted to clarify one point starbucks isnt losing money in q they made had a net revenue of million or cents per share which is down from billion or per share a year earlier the issue is the declining revenue despite growing the number of stores by net new stores in q ending the period with stores and a increase in average ticket the end result is they are going to reward their stockholders by passing on costscharging their customers more their goal is by increasing net revenue that it will also increase the stock price,OutOfTheLoop,No Slang

answer public schools are primarily funded through property taxes it is an inherently unequal system which gives much more funding to schools in high value districts than in poor however public schooling does allow for an equal opportunity for education no matter the socioeconomic class of the parent if the doe funding ended tomorrow those property taxes funding the public schools in theory would disappear this would not benefit renters or trailer owners this would minimally benefit poor land owners but this would greatly benefit wealthy land owners and landlords as their children are the least likely to be attending public school in the first place so now the poor will have to pay for their childrens education regardless of if they own land or can afford it and wealthy landowners will no longer subsidize public education which they heavily rely on for the education of the skilled and unskilled labor they used to grow their wealth it is just another example of passing the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class yet again and calling it freedom or something,OutOfTheLoop,No Slang

there are pros and cons on the one hand you have access to pretty much every single pc game ever made if youre willing to troubleshoot download files and patches you have the ability to mod enhance and just generally tailor the experience to your liking on the other hand hardware is expensive and right now modern releases suffer awful performance and there isnt much you can do except throw money at it and hope you can brute force the problems away then you have rd party launchers which are buggy and awful looking at uplay etc if youre in two minds honestly you wont be losing much by sticking to consoles if youre only interested in modern releases but if youre looking for games that you simply cant get on a console older games or mods then a pc is the best call sometimes i miss the ease of use of a console but i do love the freedom of a pc,gaming,No Slang

one thing found with layden he talks a lot of things contradictory to what he did he talks about rising budgets and unsustainability yet he was one of the executives who pushed the path they were on his quote fewer but bigger is exactly what was wrong with sonys lineup of titles that it took jim ryan to push indies focus back into playstation at some point his insights become worthless also generally about sonys titles budgets and purpose of consoles and talk about sustainability i think people tend to forget that most of their business revenue and profits dont revolve around first party titles first party only accounted for of all software sales last quarter including their ports their biggest profits has always been being a platform whether that be third party sales mtx subs and this generation has been the most profitable sony has ever been reason why they havent fully committed like ms has regards to porting is same reason why they didnt fully drop titles on subscriptions when ms was doing the same and there was immense pressure to do so potential long term damage we saw how sony tested horizon on ps plus a year later and it devastated its sales and then they never did a year release on subs since there used to be a time when they had the mindset that titles drove platform uniqueness and made all sorts of title think every generation theyve literally lost parts of that identity remains to be seen if they turn it around think they better act much faster than theyre doing because steam is now overtaking playstation as place where people buy third party sales too honestly reading the interview layden sounds like an former executive who has literally no ounce of competitive drive failing to see how nintendosteam are direct competitors at this point and would roll over as soon as stronger competition comes through which is kind of happening now rather than looking at understanding why the brand is losing relevancy how they can go about improving the platform experience honestly theres a lot to improve on especially as things are shifting towards digital and i know where id trust my purchases more and its not on ps,gaming,No Slang

i liked the expansion united offensive better but cod is a classic was more a let down it looked better and was still cinematic but the constant respawning enemies until you found the spot where theyd stop and start spawning at the next point made it meh still way better than newer games though online the og and uo were great especially uo with some of the base assault maps they were absolutely massive though foy sucked to be on the allied side since you could hit i think at least one of the bases with the s from across the map maybe two of them i also spent an inordinate amount of time on what i think was the only retrieval server the game ever got i played uo on that server regularly for about a decade id play base assault if no one was on or ctf rarely tdm but they were all generally fun i just preferred the objectivebased modes over death match was a major let down online with much smaller maps lacking in character then the shotgun which was basically broken due to the small maps power and accuracy at range but they had cut the recoil on most of the weapons a thompson was as good as a garand or for sniping across the maps which were so small that the scoped and bolt action rifles were a liability the semiautos were also nerfed so they were lacking in damage yet the smgs and stgbrenbar were just given less recoil and more accuracy as a primarily rifle player it sucked on any cod map so i went back to and uo i havent played any cod online since from videos ive not missed anything i did play world at war which was a major downgrade from in everything but graphics i remember enjoying the gamecube games big red one and finest hour as well as just not as much as uo i definitely think they should have been ported over,gaming,No Slang

i was a regular church goer for most of my life as was my wife kids baptized active in choir taught bible study volunteer efforts the works when my wife was diagnosed with metastatic cancer her treatments became very rough and her health deteriorated rapidly this was preobamacare days and she wasnt covered under my employers insurance plan due to preexisting condition clauses we had been tithing regularly and were giving extra towards the churches new building fund we had to stop that to make ends meet but still tithed what we could the senior pastor contacted us and asked why and i told him and he asked if he and the deacons could do a special prayer session for her health we showed up to the session laying on of hands and whole process it was emotionally nurturing but her health continued to spiral each visit we got more and more bad news finally a diagnosis of stage and she was given only months to live we were once again approached by our pastor who asked to come to our home and see us during that visit the godless bastard looked straight at her and said she must have some hidden sin that was preventing her from being healed and this was gods way of pushing her to seek the better path blah blah blah my wife was sitting there oxygen tubes up her nose no hair down lbs from her vibrant precancer self and could barely speak above a whisper and he had the gall to accuse her of committing some hidden sin stopping god from granting her healing i threw him out of our home i refuse to worship any god that needs to play with their creation to somehow get off on praise thats bullshit she died one of the most wholesome women ive ever known and several years later id learn that pastor was diddling several kids in the congregation if god exists its not in any church church was designed to glorify evil men edit this blew up overnight for some followup to common questions im seeing in the replies to my post first thank you for your support understanding and even pointing out that one bad pastor and this man was truly vile doesnt condemn an entire religion you are right it doesnt and shouldnt but ive since encountered this in so many other religious settings i know the bible well enough to know theres literally the opposite support for this belief that you are being punished for some secret sin bad people often flourish in this world good people often suffer i dont understand that other than to understand that good or bad suffering is the human condition and all faith can offer often with great effect is a means to endure it i have been in a few churches since that one and each of them i felt more and more convinced that its the manwoman behind the pulpit and their character that defines that church which means its more of a congregation of charisma and influence than any meaningful expression of worship of god thusi no longer go to church its a flawed institution and ive found no need to attend any church to maintain a spiritual outlook i still tithe but now its donations to charitable orgs that i research carefully and have a proven track record of actually helping othersand either via coincidence or design none of those orgs are affiliated with any particular religious institution and for those asking not mormon not catholic not sda straight up nondenominational christian church one of the larger ones in the region responsible for spinning off many other versions of the same megachurch the pastor disappeared for several years after the incident but later reappeared at another church i dont blame god for allowing that pastor to continue to live and prosper i blame the church for allowing thateven more proof to me that the institution of church is the problem,AskReddit,No Slang

answer he was recently a wellestablished star of korean dramas and by some considered to be a top talent recently a young actress who started as a child actress but continued to work steadily took her own life after a dui years ago why is this context important well she was cyber bullied about her crime public opinion took a nose dive and basically she lost all of her endorsements and was cut from current and future projects two years from that seeing no hope she took her life beginning of this year sorry if the timelines confusing recently her aunt dropped the bombshell that she and kim soohyun were dating when she was years old and he was they dated for years it has been an onslaught of information coming out notably that she committed suicide on his birthday apparently she also borrowed money from him but because she wasnt working couldnt pay it back upwards of in usd he was apparently suing her to get it back the agency that he owns was also representing her and her aunt believes that the agency did not do enough to protect her niece obviously brands do not want to be associated with that and he was dropped theres more coming out but none of the details get any better korea has a history of celebrities being harassed by netizens made even more convoluted by the fact that some celebrities are actually committing crimes or being awful people netizens dont discriminate and go after the innocent and guilty alike im not an expert but i believe is the age of consent in korea but thats based off of a comment i read elsewhere so im not sure how true that is regardless a year old man dating a year old girl is disgusting and abhorrent behavior in the beginning i was a bit suspicious because the aunt came out with the info months after her nieces passing thinking it was some weird blackmail attempt photos came out and texts so i guess its true enough damage has been done to his image anyway that prada has dropped him and im sure more endorsements are to follow,OutOfTheLoop,No Slang

this varies by restaurant so there is no one right answer but at restaurants that prioritize drivethru at the expense of everything else they let the counter orders languish until there is a lull in drive through work to be done so its either a wash or its faster to just go drive through even for app orders if its a place that you can order ahead of actually arriving and where they will just place your order on a shelf unattended then going inside can be faster and your food will likely be cold but if its mcdonalds where they wont make your online order until gps confirms you are at the restaurant going inside is rolling the dice mcdonalds gives extreme priority to keeping the drivethru line moving,funny,No Slang
