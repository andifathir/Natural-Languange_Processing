"Because the benefits to joining a union are not always obvious, tangible, or applicable to a given individual. And those that are, are often obtained whether the individual is in the union or not. And humans in general are really bad at choosing long term collective good over short term individual gain (news flash: most humans are inherently selfish creatures), so sometimes you need to force their hand for the greater good.

" I get what Hong Myung-bo is saying. We‚Äôve been hearing about Minjae‚Äôs Achilles for months now it seems like. But I mean the player always has an opinion on this too and obviously players always want to play. Kim clearly felt like he could play so he played. Over the past couple weeks or so Minjae had I think 2 instances where he didn‚Äôt start a game and Eric Dier came in (and played well too) but then Upamecano got hurt so Minjae stepped in again. 

I think at first Kompany was hesitant to play Dier because he‚Äôs definitely lacking the pace of Kim and Upa but Dier is so good with his positioning and ball playing that he‚Äôs figured out how to mitigate his lack of pace issues. So yeah, Dier has started to play a bit more recently as the 3rd option to rotate either of Kim and Upa but this only recently started happening. 

Ultimately tho Kim has decided to keep playing. He got ‚Äúrest‚Äù from practice time to time and I‚Äôm sure the medical staff was monitoring him closely. While I understand the frustration of Korea, I just think it really came down to Kim wanting to push through.

"One thing found with Layden, he talks a lot of things contradictory to what he did. He talks about rising budgets and unsustainability yet, he was one of the executives who pushed the path they were on. His quote "" fewer but bigger"" is exactly what was wrong with Sony's lineup of titles that it took Jim Ryan to push indies focus back into PlayStation. At some point his insights become worthless. 

Also generally about Sony's titles, budgets and purpose of consoles and talk about sustainability, I think people tend to forget that most of their business revenue and profits don't revolve around first party titles. First party only accounted for 10% of all software sales last quarter including their ports.  Their biggest profits has always been being a platform whether that be third party sales, MTX, subs and this generation has been the most profitable Sony has ever been. Reason why they haven't fully committed like MS has regards to porting is same reason why they didn't fully drop titles on subscriptions when MS was doing the same and there was immense pressure to do so, potential long term damage. We saw how Sony tested Horizon on PS plus a year later and it devastated it's sales and then they never did a year release on subs since. There used to be a time when they had the mindset that titles drove platform uniqueness and made all sorts of title. Think every generation they've literally lost parts of that identity remains to be seen if they turn it around. Think they better act much faster than they're doing because Steam is now overtaking PlayStation as place where people buy third party sales too. Honestly reading the interview Layden sounds like an former executive who has literally no ounce of competitive drive (failing to see how Nintendo/Steam are direct competitors at this point) and would roll over as soon as stronger competition comes through (which is kind of happening now) rather than looking at understanding why the brand is losing relevancy, how they can go about improving the platform experience. (honestly there's a lot to improve on especially as things are shifting towards digital and I know where I'd trust my purchases more and it's not on PS).",No Slang,gaming

"Answer: There are a few reasons people are hating on it, ranging from reasonable to racist.

Probably the loudest group of people are upset at the casting of Rachel Zegler, who is Latina, as Snow White.  The most charitable reading of this is that in the original fairytale, Snow White is described as having ""skin as white as Snow"".  The less charitable assessment is of this is that a large group of the people upset about it are being racist, and probably wouldn't have raised a stink about it if a white woman of European descent had been cast, though if you really wanted to be 100% accurate to the original Grimm tale you'd have to hire someone with albinism, cake them in powder and dye their hair black.

A smaller group is probably upset over the casting of Gal Gadot as the wicked queen for a couple reasons.  The most negligible of these is criticism of her acting, but a stronger one is her vociferous support of Israel's recent bombing campaign and treatment of Palestinians.

A third possible reason is the weird back and forth on how they're handling the seven dwarves, with the use of widely ridiculed CGI creations that most people agree are incredibly off-putting.

And finally, plenty are just tired of the factory-like churn of Disney remaking their classic animated hits as live action/realistic CGI at a pace that makes them feel like soulless cash grabs.",No Slang,OutOfTheLoop

"I think you're overthinking it. I hold with the school of thought that emotions are physiological. Studies have shown that we unconsciously mix up emotions with similar physical reactions. For example, sweaty palms and a racing pulse due to something like fear from being on a rollercoaster may be conflated with attraction to the person you happened to be on the rollercoaster with. The idea is that we have the physical reaction and *then* our brains fill in the emotion causing it.

And those reactions are basic reward and punishment. We feel tenderness when looking at a baby because that's evolution's way of motivating us to take care of our young. Dogs and cats show similar instincts. Really, there's no evolutionary reason for emotions except to motivate us to do or not do things.

"Answer: The ‚Äû4D chess move‚Äú is probably simply the mar-a-lago accord. This is a tremendous gamble on the back of the whole world, especially the people already struggling, let alone the American people.

Check out this (clean archive.ph link) interesting article by Heike Buchta in the Germany paper ‚ÄûZeit‚Äú. You‚Äôd need to translate it into English though.

The articles premise is that Trump wants some kind of global economic reordering, by use of the so called mar-a-lago accord. The reason, besides the long term plan with the crazy 100 year bonds, is to make the US dollar weak to be able to refinance the crushing deficit the US is facing, at lower interest rates.

I know, the quote says something along the lines of never attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity or some such, but if you read through the Zeit article, nearly every insane thing Don does - e.g. Greenland, Canada, Panama Canal, Ukraine, NATO - makes sense (note that I don‚Äôt think this plan or how it is being executed is good or even reasonable in any way‚Ä¶ on the contrary).",No Slang,OutOfTheLoop

They say it‚Äôs remission but have to monitor for years in case they missed some cells that grow into more tumours. Even after all that it‚Äôs not guaranteed. And that‚Äôs in one person. Singular. 

Do you know how impossible it would be to account for the millions of dna mutations in each person‚Äôs tumours to create a one size fits all cure??? Even a cure for a singular person?? Even if they could which is not possible, cancer KEEPS mutating- odds are that cure would be defunct in a few months because of such radical cell dna changes.",No Slang,AskReddit

don‚Äôt get me wrong, i‚Äôm just trying to explain what they are probably imagining and it‚Äôs not really incorrect as far as performance/customization goes. consoles are undeniably more accessible and standardized than pcs which have significantly higher top end. this is neither good nor bad, but if someone labels hardcore as wanting the highest performance from your potential machines vs passion and investment they are going to see everything but the top half of the pc pile differently. 

also and this isn‚Äôt a critique of you, but i think it hurt your argument focusing on the console type and nice tv factor instead of the 30 years of gaming. like if instead of ‚Äúi bought a nice af tv so i am gamer‚Äù you said ‚Äúi beat x game 100%‚Äù or ‚Äúi have x hours on x game‚Äù or ‚Äúi play fighting games competitively‚Äù then it‚Äôd be less easy to read as ‚Äúoh i invested a lot of money so im hardcore‚Äù and more ‚Äúim hardcore so i invested‚Äù. hope that makes sense.",No Slang,gaming

It's pretty much explained there that publishers started spending a lot of money on content (graphics, effects, 100 hours of gameplay) and so they need a lot of sales with expensive development. Because of this, games are released everywhere.

1. Game services are at the top of the profits
2. Point 1 forces game studios to make games with big budgets and refuse exclusives, releasing games everywhere.

I think it's a paradox in a way. As long as gamers are spending a lot of money on session games, single player games and creativity at big studios will suffer.

"I've had like five men who haven't been family friends / family who have interacted with me not be awful to me since middle school started. ( Counting trans men it would be seven ) This includes a guy who said hi to me a few times and held the door open for me. So no, I don't have high standards. Pretty sure one of them had two girlfriends.  ( Nice to me not to thee. ) And one of those girlfriends was always shooting me dirty looks so maybe she at least thought he was trying to get with me. One I sit with awkwardly in class and he doesn't insult me and has said hi to me a few times so I count him. There are some more men but they said such awful things about our teachers I won't even add them to the count. 

I live in a blue state. 

Please don't blame me when I'm a little more unsure of men than women as my number for women past middle school being nicer would be much larger. My number for men hurting me vs women hurting me would be much larger as well. Maybe when I get past highschool this prejudice won't be as needed but school boys at least are majority awful from what I've seen, met, heard, realized. 

Group of boys in my middle would talk about gang b/nging the teachers women or man. Two/three harassed me. My p.e teacher assaulted me and the guys who harassed me called me a liar when I came out about it. Changed middle schools. The first day a guy came up to me, told me to look to my side, then grabbed my face and turned it towards him then walked away. 

I've been asked 'What color is it? is it pink?' 'Want to get with my friend?' ( I was having a breakdown about whether or not I want to go back into a mental hospital, didn't know those guys, they asked it will walking past, not the goddamn time. ) 'Hey my friend likes you!' yeah thanks I know that it should be considered an insult to have any feelings or care for me! 

'Yeah [ my name ] is my girlfriend.' I am not. Was not. Never will be. 'Hey what do you think about my friend?' 'Hes weird I don't know him and he keeps calling me his girlfriend.' I felt bad for being too harsh in front of everyone.  *the guy kept calling me his girlfriend after that so I guess not harsh enough though.* 

I don't think I have that heavy of a prejudice when I'm actually faced towards a guy in person, unfortunately.
 But please don't blame other girls/women for having one it would probably benefit me greatly if I did and girls/women don't owe men/boys compliance and to be gentle and polite and considerate when treated with the opposite behavior repeatedly.

The point was to get them in proximity to the point that violence occurs and drives a wedge deeper in the American people.  

The left needs to learn how to protest in ways that the right can't infiltrate with bad actors that justify use of force. 

Better yet. Don't go to physical protests. They dont accomplish much anymore. 

In the past, it was a demonstration that people were willing to get off their butts and use a day up to make sure they're heard. This theoretically could translate to votes on election day.

Fort Knox is also somewhat secretive in public repute, providing few details, guided visits and inspections despite its vaunted public reputation as a store of valuables in movies and culture.(eg James Bond Goldfinger's heist). There aren't many public audits of the gold 

This leads to conspiracy theories that maybe the gold isn't actually there. Eg That it was used for some nefarious purpose .

Many people who are upset about this view it as an infringement on freedom of speech and due process. Additionally, the way he was detained was unusual and caused some to believe this is a gestapo style detainment.

Mahmoud is a greencard holder which is a privilege not a right and like any other privilege it can be revoked with or without reason at any time prior to naturalization. A greencard holder does not have the same rights and protections as an American citizen. Committing crimes is the easiest way to lose this status. In the event the federal government decides to revoke green card status, it would be ICE who would be responsible for detaining the greencard holder and this would happen without a warrant or due process.

Contrary to popular belief, freedom of speech is not unlimited. It is a federal crime in the US to provide resources or support for any designated terrorist organization. In this case, HAMAS has been designated as a terrorist organization since 1997 and Mahmoud was on video chanting support for them and screaming ""death to America"".

"Answer: dude has a Canada flag on his username in Tiktok, it seems. I am Canadian so let me talk about what is going on here.

Canada has taken in a few million immigrants in the last few years, with a considerable majority of them being from India. This has put a lot of pressure on housing and job markets, which hurt a lot of people.

The people actually responsible for this are:

* REIT investors, who thrive on inflating rent and enjoy the extra pressure on the market;

* Corporations that prefer temporary foreign workers over local labour. Because even though those under a work visa have a right to a minimum wage, they lack many guarantees and (de facto) rights a Canadian has, and thus make for a more loyal and desperate workforce.

* Politicians all across the spectrum, who could have put a cap on immigration and manage it in a sustainable manner, but who decided to appease to the two other groups above.

We could, as a people, criticise those three groups and work to find a solution to our problems. But unfortunately, human nature being what it is, a lot of us decided to just be racist instead.",No Slang,OutOfTheLoop

I‚Äôm also hearing conflicted viewpoints that he doesn‚Äôt want to actually to do anything to the parks, and that he couldn‚Äôt if he wanted to anyways since the parks are protected.

Brothers was a single player game in which you controlled both characters with a single controller, one side for each. Co-op was added in the remake, but it's very much not the same core/concept.

"> If anything a 3 year deal actually protects his value more.

This line is completely wrong if you're not specifying offering a longer deal in exchange for lower wage demands.

The downside of having a washed player on 300/400k per week is much higher than maybe having to negotiate again in 1 or 2 years.

Saudi is already at a somewhat of a saturation point with almost all teams having fille their foreign player slots, meaning they now have to sell before buying (and their players might be hard to move given inflated wages).

All this also assumes that Salah will accept going to Saudi, and even if he is willing to go, unless the fee is sizeable, there is likely no benefit for him being contracted for longer rather than just renegotiating

So it's much easier for them to keep saying ""I'm the smart one and you're stupid for not understanding Trump's genius"" than it is to say ""I've ruined my own life and everybody that's been telling me that I'm wrong for the last decade was actually right"".",No Slang,OutOfTheLoop

"Because of our ""first past the post"" voting system, larger political parties have a huge advantage. Smaller parties tend to split the vote in a way that makes it very hard for them to win elections. Consider a simple example with one big party that tends to get 40% of the vote, then several smaller parties that tend to get 30%, 20%, and 10%. The party that gets 40% will win almost every single election, even though a majority of voters preferred other options.

It's not like a proportional representation system, or a parliamentary system where the small parties can form a coalition. In our system, the smaller parties end up locked out of government almost completely. 

As a result, groups tend to consolidate into bigger and bigger parties, which tends to stabilize once there are two political parties that each get about 50% of the vote. That's what we have today.

"His results were perfectly what we expect. If there are no visible shapes to be seen, the camera can't see them. LIDAR and RADAR are far better for self driving. We humans can interpret our surroundings and map them to a 3D ""map"" of where things are in relation with each other. Even before we get to object recognition part, we don't need to really identify object to know how far it is. Having a constant real time 3D map is FAR easier data for computers to handle, the most important part of the process is done by the imaging device itself: gauge distances. We don't need to know what it is to be able to make decisions.

Image recognition is ass backwards: utilize sophisticated algorithms that require a lot of processing power and are almost impossible to make fool proof to achieve something that a LIDAR/RADAR can do without ANY processing: we simply list all the points in XYZ space and check where they are in relation to our trajectory. We can do further processing but it is very simple and fast, points close together in 3D space are most likely part of the same object.. It is all just pure logic, it is not complicated at all. The entire problem with them resides in the hardware that is used for sensing.

So, they are not using the expensive hardware but instead try to do it the hard way that is guaranteed to fail more just to save some money but from engineering standpoint it is INSANE idea. Even if the end goal is image recognition alone, it should be trained with LIDAR in place for a LOOOOONG time because of safety. Tesla is beta and alpha testing with end consumers on the public roads. Everything they do is ass backwards from safety and engineering point of view but absolutely logical if saving and making money is #1.

"I was a regular church goer for most of my life, as was my wife.  Kids baptized, active in choir, taught bible study, volunteer efforts, the works.

When my wife was diagnosed with metastatic cancer her treatments became very rough and her health deteriorated rapidly.  This was pre-Obamacare days and she wasn‚Äôt covered under my employers insurance plan due to pre-existing condition clauses.  We had been tithing regularly and were giving extra towards the churches new building fund.  We had to stop that to make ends meet but still tithed what we could.  The senior pastor contacted us and asked why and I told him and he asked if he and the deacons could do a special prayer session for her health.  

We showed up to the session, laying on of hands and whole process.  It was emotionally nurturing but her health continued to spiral.  Each visit we got more and more bad news.  Finally, a diagnosis of Stage 4 and she was given only months to live.  We were once again approached by our pastor who asked to come to our home and see us.

During that visit the godless bastard looked straight at her and said she must have some ‚Äúhidden sin‚Äù that was preventing her from being healed and this was Gods way of pushing her to seek the better path blah blah blah.

My wife was sitting there, oxygen tubes up her nose, no hair, down 60lbs from her vibrant pre-cancer self and could barely speak above a whisper.  And he had the gall to accuse her of committing some hidden ‚Äúsin‚Äù stopping God from granting her healing.

I threw him out of our home.  I refuse to worship any God that needs to play with their creation to somehow get off on praise.  That‚Äôs bullshit.

She died one of the most wholesome women I‚Äôve ever known and several years later I‚Äôd learn that pastor was diddling several kids in the congregation.

If God exists it‚Äôs not in any church.  Church was designed to glorify evil men.

**EDIT**

This blew up overnight.  For some follow-up to common questions I‚Äôm seeing in the replies to my post‚Ä¶.

First, thank you for your support, understanding and even pointing out that one bad pastor (and this man was truly vile) doesn‚Äôt condemn an entire religion.  You are right, it doesn‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt.  But I‚Äôve since encountered this in so many other religious settings.  I know the Bible well enough to know there‚Äôs literally the opposite support for this belief that ‚Äúyou are being punished for some secret sin.‚Äù  Bad people often flourish in this world.  Good people often suffer.  I don‚Äôt understand that, other than to understand that good or bad, suffering is the human condition and all faith can offer (often with great effect) is a means to endure it.  

I have been in a few churches since that one, and each of them I felt more and more convinced that its the man/woman behind the pulpit and their character that defines that church.  Which means it‚Äôs more of a congregation of charisma and influence than any meaningful expression of worship of God.  Thus‚Ä¶.I no longer go to church.  It‚Äôs a flawed institution and I‚Äôve found no need to attend any church to maintain a spiritual outlook.  I still ‚Äòtithe‚Äô but now it‚Äôs donations to charitable orgs that I research carefully and have a proven track record of actually helping others‚Ä¶.and either via coincidence or design, NONE of those orgs are affiliated with any particular religious institution.   

And for those asking.  Not Mormon.  Not Catholic.  Not SDA.  Straight up non-denominational christian church.  One of the larger ones in the region, responsible for spinning off many other versions of the same mega-church.  The pastor disappeared for several years after the incident but later re-appeared at another church.  I don‚Äôt blame God for allowing that pastor to continue to live and prosper.  I blame the Church for allowing that‚Ä¶.even more proof to me that the institution of Church is the problem.",No Slang,AskReddit

Watchmen is deeply moving. When all the insignificant side characters die from the alien, i started crying, ugly crying. It's one of the bleakest things to ever happen in comics and it's because of a giant fake alien squid

It's a serious story, incredibly serious and meditative but Alan Moore is firmly on the side of the ""comics are for kids"" tribe where comics are inherently silly.

">USA alienated itself from the rest of the world, again. Showed they would rather let Russia conquer and sell the spoils than help defend democracy and freedom. Any goodwill America had is essentially gone now.

I dont think people fully grasp what this means. Ever since the end of WW2, so roughly 80 years, the United States has been the unquestioned leader of the Western World. Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, roughly 40 years, the United States has been the unquestioned leader of the entire World. That has changed today.

Every time the US pushes for favorable trade conditions with any part of the world, the rest of the western world pushes alongside for those conditions. Every western nation purchases goods but especially sophisticated weaponry and looks to the United States to set standards for their military. Most of these nations either have little or no domestic military industry, meaning they spend all of that money with US based companies or through licensing agreements. That has changed today.

By publicly throwing an ally under the bus the rest of the world has been very publicly shown they cannot ever rely on the US to cultivate shared interests and when once a joint and standardized military arrangement like NATO was seen as an incredible strength, it is now an incredible liability.

This will have negative ripple effects for the US for generations.",No Slang,OutOfTheLoop

"There is absolute no risk in paying Mohamed Salah the money he'll likely want, even on a three year deal. If anything a 3 year deal actually protects his value more.

He's going to be 33 next season but he's coming off his most efficient season ever, and we're so reliant on him and will continue to rely on him due to the lack of attacking talent in world football that can produce close to his rate. He's never injured, looks after himself and has become a lot smarter with how he conserves energy throughout games.

Now the major reason I see no risk in this is that, even if he did fall off a cliff next year, he is the most attractive asset to Saudi Arabia outside of the absolute elite younger talents (Mbappe, Haaland, Vini). Next summer Saudi Arabia are 100% still willing to spend silly money on him even if he does have a down year, so theres little risk in paying him the money he likely wants.

Then for new players, if they come in and want that money as well, tell them if they perform like Salah for a decade they'll get it as well. It's a great structure to show you reward long term success and loyalty to a club.",No Slang,soccer

">¬†in general I do feel like people hold self driving cars to a way higher standard than they should


If you are trusting the computer to drive your car, it should be held to a high standard.


Real driving has problems and difficulties beyond what an exaggerated cruise control can handle.


Lets say we stick the current gen of self-driving cars out on the road as self-driving, no human with a license needed. Now what happens when it rains? When it snows? Suddenly everything on the road is visually obscured. Road lines aren't clear anymore, GPS may be interrupted and spotty.


What do you propose the result will be? If the cars just decide not to drive, suddenly everyone in the city is stranded with a car wherever they happen to be. There's not enough taxis and tow trucks for everyone to get home when their cars decide not to drive. Practically speaking, the only acceptable solution drivers would accept would be the cars attempt to drive in inclement weather regardless. And predictably, if they do a bad job of it, it's going to cause a lot of crashes and accidents.


Like, self-driving can't target just working 80% of the time, people need their cars all of the time, even during emergencies. The self-driving has to be good enough to handle the worst situations.",No Slang,OutOfTheLoop

\*Adaptive Difficulty goes up from such things as dealing damage and enemy attacks NOT hitting. It goes down from such things as taking damage and missing shots.  
\*As it goes up and down in increments, it will shift between ""Ranks"" where certain mechanics change such as damage multipliers and enemy aggression.  
\*Professional is always locked to Rank 10.  
\*Easy treats all Ranks above 5 as if it were Rank 5 game mechanic-wise, but still ""keeps track"" as if it were Normal difficulty.\*Enemy aggression is hard to quantify, but as an example, Del Lago rarely touches stumps at Rank 5 and mostly swims in straight lines. At Rank 10, it will constantly hit stumps. One ""nice"" thing about Pro is that, since enemies are always at maximum aggression, their behavior becomes more predictable. Lower Adaptive Difficulty will have them take pauses between attacks and run at you less often.

"Rome was constantly reinventing itself throughout its existence even into the Imperial era. You have the Principate which is Augustus through the Crisis of the Third Century. During this time there was one Emperor and one Emperor alone. To vastly over simplify as time wore on it became apparent that one man couldn't rule over all of that  territory alone, and after the Crisis of the Third Century Diocletian overhauled the system into the Tetrarchy, which split the empire into four administrative districts, increasing the # of emperors to four. The system as Diocletian envisioned it was very flawed (senior emperors were supposed to voluntarily retire, they weren't supposed to have blood successors) but when Constantine took over he kept the idea of a split empire, though paring it back to two. 

Corruption did certainly exist in Rome, and in the fifth century in the West, there was an unusually high amount of corruption that *combined with multiple exogenous shocks to the system* such as Atilla the Hun would eventually weaken the western empire enough that it would fall. But Rome's transition to empire was not the instant kiss of death Edward Gibbon would have you believe by any measure.",No Slang,gaming

Since I moved here in the 90's they're still vocally fighting the Civil War. 

When I was in high school, they still had Lee Jackson King Day. All the Mosely boys would muster in the Food Lion parking lot. They'd drive over to the high school in a convoy and stop in the parking lot bottle neck and play Dixie on a loud speaker and fly the Confederate flags high. Then our vice principal would pull them into the office and they'd whine about ""my free speech"" and ""it's my heritage, not hate"" and as soon as they thought nobody was listening they'd call her the n-word. They used to drive around off school property with little nooses hanging from their rear view mirrors. Fucking cowards. 

I'm still friends with a lot of these guys on Facebook. And yes they still regurgitate all the same racist bullshit that they used to. They haven't changed. They're deeply entrenched in their beliefs that their ancestors were somehow victims. And they are continuing to fight the fight.

Is this seemingly fascist behavior common on reddit? Are differing opinions really not tolerated? Is this how reddit wishes to further it's growing reputation as being not inclusive? 

Do the subreddit mods think that people will come here from X (like I did) and not instead flea to X so they're not silenced for expressing opinions that affect their personal opinions rather than moderate subjectively?

"I haven‚Äôt seen this one yet (could be wrong) but I‚Äôll say that true independence and consequences from that independence become a bit more apparent when you‚Äôre 30+ 

When you‚Äôre a teenager there felt like there was always a standing obligation to your parents, boss, teachers/professors, coaches, etc. to fulfill things and meet certain expectations. 

Now after getting older I‚Äôve come to realize that sure you may have a boss and parents, but the sense of obligation deteriorates dramatically. Yes, you still have to do you work and hustle, but it‚Äôs less about meeting an expectation it‚Äôs more about personal fulfillment and being able to function as an independent adult. No one is around to save you that much anymore, so being bad with money or socially will bite you a bit more. If you are fortunate to still have that situation of saviors somewhere, the guilt and stigma of relying on others at an older age can also weigh on a person. 

It‚Äôs a multifaceted evolution of something people think is trivial when they are a teenager and experience their typical first spark of independence going to college or working out of high school or earlier",No Slang,AskReddit

Usually, while I'm there, there were quite a few people who, like me, couldn't have walked/crawled/dragged themselves to an exit.

Still, it was kind of creepy feeling being shut into my room for a fire drill, and knowing that I would have to be in my room if the building WERE on fire. Maybe the rooms have some kind of fireproof doors or walls??? My room was on the sixth floor. I was underwhelmed.",No Slang,NoStupidQuestions

It is the ultimate responsibility for SB to benefit their shareholders, not their customers.

I fell into the Starbucks trap, and the coffee shop/latte stand trap in the very early 90's. That ended abruptly after I decided to look at my finances more carefully *and* doing some simple math. I was spending over $1200 a year on coffee shop coffee. I was literally pissing money away. I got my old coffee maker out of the pantry, loaded it up and I've never looked back. If I had kept buying coffee till now, it's likely I'd be up to $1900 to $2100 a year.  So. Let's say on the average $1650 for 23 years. That's $38,000.00. At $1650 a year deposited into a Roth IRA for the last 33 years I would have just under $182,000.00 sitting there today. 

Where is the smart money when it comes to coffee? 

And how many 10s of thousands of gallons of fuel are consumed annually for people that are too lazy to park their car and do the drive through for a coffee loaded with saturated fat?

"As I understand it, and I could be wrong:

First we have to look at where the contamination would come from: germs in the environment, people touching the product, residue from manufacturing, and contaminants from the material itself.

Second the manufacturing process: a. the sheet plastic is generally made by blowing a bubble in a large vat of molten plastic, grabbing the bubble from above and feeding it through a roller system. The size of the sheet/bag is controlled by the speed of drawing, the feed of air into the bubble, and the temperature of the plastic. The plastic starts at a temperature that kills germs from the environment.

b. The plastic is generally not touched by workers during the manufacture. The automated machines roll the plastic, trim it to size, weld on the zipper, seal the edges, cut the individual bags from the continuous length, collate into numbered stacks, and stuff & seal the stacks into packaging. Humans generally only touch the beginning and end of the rolls of material, and since the product must be food safe, they wear gloves & probably masks. The machines have to stay food safe and are serviced with food safe products. The material itself stays protected while on the rolls by being covered by the many layers of material.

The plastic used is food safe itself. It is heated, fused, and generally untouched. As far as I know (and I could be wrong) it is much more costly to stop a non-food-safe production line, clean the line to safety standards, and start it again with food safe materials than it is to make products that are not required to be food safe with food safe materials. Almost all 3-5 gallon buckets made in the US are food safe even if not labled as such for this reason.

And as an added bonus: WD-40 is a food safe product. I would not suggest putting it on your salad, but a spritz on the manufacturing line could mean a tiny bit of mineral oil makes it onto the bag. Which if you put cold pepperoni pizza in the bag is the least of your worries.",No Slang,NoStupidQuestions

"Answer: I‚Äôve never heard of it before today but I found out about it when all of a sudden all off my friends were talking about having a ‚ÄúNe Zha‚Äù watch party. We looked it up on Amazon Prime video and from the cover I just thought it was just a cheap Chinese animation movie or it was a meme or something. Watching it, I realized it was actually really really good. It tells a very compelling story about a Demon learning to defy his destiny and become a hero. The story and animation are very impressive and is onpar with Disney and Pixar (like 95% of the time)

So after watching the movie it‚Äôs pretty clear that the sequel *** must have been a crazy success in China. It‚Äôs not often that an animation of this caliber comes out and is not from a major animation studio and considering that China now has 1.411 billion people it‚Äôs not unbelievable that this movie is the most grossing animated film OAT.",No Slang,OutOfTheLoop

RNG drops aren't fun and engaging and grinding isn't a substitute for things to do.

"Answer: Public schools are primarily funded through property taxes. It is an inherently unequal system which gives much more funding to schools in high value districts than in poor. 

However, public schooling does allow for an ""equal"" opportunity for education, no matter the socioeconomic class of the parent. If the DOE funding ended tomorrow, those property taxes funding the public schools, in theory, would disappear. This would NOT benefit renters, or trailer owners. This would minimally benefit poor land owners. But this would greatly benefit wealthy land owners and landlords, as their children are the least likely to be attending public school in the first place... 

So, now the poor will HAVE to pay for their children's education, regardless of if they own land or can afford it, and wealthy landowners will no longer subsidize public education - which they HEAVILY rely on for the education of the skilled and unskilled labor they used to grow their wealth. 

It is just another example of passing the tax burden from the wealthy to the poor and middle class (yet again) and calling it ""freedom"" or something....",No Slang,OutOfTheLoop

"Answer: For obvious reasons, security at Fort Knox is insanely tight due to the fact that something like 5,000 tons of gold are stored there, and as a result, getting the ability to actually see the gold is difficult and arduous.  This is because if you can see the gold, then you are also in the theoretical position to be able to take some of it with you, and that would be very bad.

Given that fact that almost no one can actually see the gold, there's a popular conspiracy theory that pops up every now and then that dates back at least to the 1970s that, somehow, when no one was looking, some or all of the 5,000 tons of gold at Fort Knox has actually been stolen, and people are actively working to keep that fact a secret.  This conspiracy theory hypothesizes that the actual reason almost no one can see it is because it's not there and this is all a coverup, rather than the more mundane reality that they just don't want anyone to be in a position to get their hands on the gold.

The mental image of a massive heist of thousands of tons of gold from the US Treasury is an inherently spectacular one, and as such, is exactly the sort of cool-sounding shiny distraction that captivates manchildren like Trump and Musk.

"Social conservatism is often associated with maintaining or upholding traditional values and beliefs. The idea of a person changing their associated gender, regardless of the sex they were assigned at birth, has always been around. But it's never been taken nearly as seriously as in recent decades, nor has it had this high of cultural acceptance. So a lot of social conservatives consider the theory of gender identity being flexible as radical, new, and not supported by science (regardless of whether that last one's true or not).

>I hear the word freedom thrown around a lot but then why constantly try to restrict these people‚Äôs freedom to be themselves or whoever they want to be when they‚Äôre not hurting anyone?

This is just a guess, but I think there may be a few overlaps here, with the backlash that same-sex marriage experienced in the late 2000's. Back then, opponents of same-sex marriage branded themselves as defenders of the institution of marriage, and that the idea of legalizing it would involve the government telling churches (that facilitate marriages) what to do. But as more states legalized it, and people realized that their marriages and churches remained the same, I think people realized how little validity these arguments had.

Similarly, I think social conservatives have a fear that legal requirements and social obligations would require people to act against their personal beliefs, when it comes to interacting with (or providing services to) trans people. Like it shouldn't matter to anyone else what letter a trans person has on their passport for ""Sex"", But people have outstanding questions about trans inclusion in gender-segregated sports teams, or how a parent can make decisions on how to help their teenager explore their gender identity without jumping the gun. And the answers to that aren't clear or universally understood yet. It's possible that fear and hate will reside once clearer answers are available to the public on how people can reconcile their disagreement with their ability to conduct themselves in social/professional interactions. But yes, it sucks that trans people are on the receiving end of bullying and discrimination in the meantime.

It's true that social conservatives support individual liberties as a traditional American value that's worth upholding, but they also tend to advocate for government regulations on those liberties **for the sake of** upholding values. Whether that's nuance, or hypocrisy, is up to personal interpretation. But they're less likely to stand by the ""let trans people do what they want, they're not hurting anyone"" stance than libertarians, who uphold individual liberties above all else.",No Slang,NoStupidQuestions

But yeah this is part of it, I sometimes and in increasing amounts want to have some chill gaming without it being ""under massive time pressure since opponent is player playing by exactly same rules and in symmetrical situation where who ever does something faster and more efficiently gains edge, and then has possibility of trying to snowball from there into even stronger position, with some playroom to surprising things or spotting some weakness in opponent, as long as  you are fast enough"".

But yeah stuff like Beyond All Reason does exist and improve in that type of games, and neatly is usually free these days to play.  
Beyond All Reason: Think about Supreme Commander but with improvements to UI and commanding units, with some convenient tools that make you go ""why were these not in already decades ago"", but taking step clear step towards Total Annihilation in style and unit selection and so.

"Answer: According to NPR, they're making this claim because he has consolidated all Ukrainian media into a single state-sponsored network, suspended 11 political parties, and removed officials from those 11 parties from office. Representatives other than Trump have raised concerns over this, including members of the Swedish Institute of International Affairs, so Trump's comments are not new, nor are they unprecedented.

There is also the notion that Zelensky has overstayed his term in office as per the Ukrainian constitution under martial law, an action that, according to political scientists, does define him as a military dictator; a position used in democracies since the Roman Republic.

The Premier League clearly doesn't suit the Brazilian play style. Bruno Guimar√£es is one of the best examples of this. He's developed and adapted perfectly to the league, but he's a tragedy whenever he steps out onto the pitch for Brazil. Whether under Tite, Fernando Diniz or Dorival Junior.

>I think there are valid criticisms and issues with the players/squad, but the BIG overarching issues is coaching IMO

Yes, but there are cases and cases. This subreddit, with their hatred of Vinicius, say he's never played well for Brazil... But that's a lie, he was Brazil's best player at the 2022 World Cup.

Since Tite left, however, he's never managed to play well. Raphinha and Rodrygo have also played well under Tite, despite their current poor form (Raphinha is perhaps the best at the moment).

I was kinda sad when they finally did get violent and I'm not sure if something changed in the development direction or it was a fluke but I thought that was revolutionary at the time. Still don't really think anyone has done something like that. Most gamers are conditioned to kill on sight and I thought my pacifists nature had discovered something others hadn't. 

I recently played sons of the forest a bit with a friend and told him of this experience, and didn't act aggressive towards the locals when they first approached. They didn't attack me for like 45 seconds, like 8 feet in front of me and posturing like they were trying to scare me away but not actually attacking. I was like ""see? I think I'm onto something right?"" To my friend over discord. Right after that I got clubbed to death lol. It's a fun thought and there's definitely something to it in their AI I feel, but peace was never an option.",No Slang,gaming

"Do you know how your rent has gone up, groceries have gone up, electric bill has gone up?

Well, those costs have gone up for food trucks too

Food trucks are also just another business ,they are not inherently ""cheap"". If anything, sometimes their costs can be just as much as a traditional restaurant in terms of food prep. They still have to meet all health codes. They have to meet minimum wage, and be competitive with the local market. And of course they need power, gas, some type of water access for hand washing, food, supplies, refigeration, etc...

$15 for 4 tacos is $3.75. That doesn't sound that bad when you consider costs. In the US you can easily spend that much on tacos, often more like $4-5 in a sit down restaurant. Plus at sit down, you have to tip.

Your 2-3 for $5 nearly a decade ago is almost irrelevant. You might as well start talking about how a movie and a talkie used to cost a nickel.

I take that as an indication that we are still as much part of our two person team as we were when we first fell in love and married, almost 48 years ago, now.

While the exact nature of this love may well have changed over the years, given that the white hot intensity of the honeymoon phase is impossible to maintain, this is more than compensated for by our continuing to learn new things about each other.  I take loving the process of learning new things about each other as a reliable indicator that our love for each other is still growing, which makes me feel younger than my actual age whenever we are together, or even whenever I think of her.

"I've been going back and forth on this a lot, but finally decided I won't buy it.

Shadows has been a marketing and PR \*nightmare\* for an entire year. I struggle to believe it's entirely incompetence. Like, at first I thought the stuff about the resemblance of the torii gate to the one left after the WWII bombing was just typical internet conspiracy drama, but now their latest special edition stuff looks like... Chinese themed?

I love Wukong. I play Chinese gacha games. It's not about China bad. What I'm trying to say, is I'm not convinced anyone working on this game, or anyone marketing this game or running PR for this game, even knows where Japan is on a map. One of their so-called consultants is shady if not an outright fraud. Even if I try to be as charitable as possible, it doesn't explain totally failing to consult with... actual Japanese experts who aren't even remotely controversial? Who are Japanese? FROM Japan?

Compare this to how Sucker Punch developed GoT, how they marketed it, worked with real kenjutsu masters from Japan, and the difference between the baseline level of respect is night and day. There's really no excuse for Ubisoft. And not even just respect toward a people or culture, but just the effort you're putting into your product, the pride you put into your work. Why wouldn't you seek out and work as closely as possible with consultants who can help you make the best version of an alternate history game about **their** country? Why would you instead settle for a person of very dubious credibility? Rhetorically asking.

In an age where there's so much talk about ""sensitivity readers"" and the like, it is simply mindboggling how these things have happened again, and again, and again, and again with this game lol. So much of this probably could have been avoided if they'd flown a random drunk salaryman off the streets of Sapporo to their studio and showed stuff to them.

I'm a weeb, but it's not about me white knighting for Japan. I'm just convinced that Ubisoft has no effing clue what they're doing. In any way, shape, or form. They don't respect the history or the culture they're attempting to represent in their game, and they insult the intelligence of consumers, and even if you set all that aside, the game looks behind the times even when it's not glitching out. There is nothing about this game I'd feel good about financially supporting, not even for the memes; the industry must do better.

"I think it is a pretty common thing to think. Especially for people who have either never been in a relationship or who haven‚Äôt been in a relationship for some time.

Personally i think it is a trap tho. Whenever this feeling makes you get into a relationship it is most of the time not the best. Why? Because you got into the relationship not because you wanted to in a sense, but instead because you feel like you have to take the chance. In my case i searched for someone to make me a better person , when in reality I and only I can make myself that better person.

My experience has taught me that whenever i get over that feeling - by making the best out of my life as it is with hobbies, going hiking, spending time with friends, going on holiday alone,‚Ä¶ - brought me not only the best memories of my entire life but also made me find my partner along the way. The more you express who you truly are and how you want to live, the more likely you will find someone who is exacly what you might search for - with no search needed.

"This is something I discovered recently. I went back with some friends to play a more ""casual"" Valheim experience, putting 3X materials and passive enemies on.

It is indeed more casual, since we didn't *have* to fight any creatures around, only the bosses to progress our gear and biomes... but that quickly reminded me that the entire game the way it is intended to be played hinges on your encounters in the wild, combating various enemies (and of course the bosses), and spending a lot more time gathering and fighting...

That is to say, It helps to actually be using your gear and leveling your skills as you explore and obtain material for your gear upgrades, and if you wish to upgrade your base materials too. Going around without combat, and not leveling those skills; it's not as satisfying to get those gear upgrades because you're not using the gear all that much to begin with. You're cutting way down on the time spent gathering and therefore defending yourself (and basically not defending yourself at all when you put passive enemies on as we did), which of course was our goal, but then it starts feeling pointless just as you said.

"Good buddy, if all you know of sex is from porn, here are a couple of important things worth keeping in mind:

1. It‚Äôs not really all that much like porn. The positions they do in porn aren‚Äôt actually all that much fun most of the time, unless you‚Äôre putting on a show for someone (a la porn actors putting on a show for the camera). 

2. You should stop watching porn a couple months before your wedding night, maybe even from here going forward. You might find that your ol fella won‚Äôt rise to the occasion.

Also, be ready for the possibility that you or your wife might not be super into it *on* the actual wedding night. Keep in mind, both you and she have been avoiding and repressing your sexual desires *your entire life*‚Ä¶ it might not be just a switch you can flick - especially for women. She might instinctively flinch, you might flinch - there‚Äôs areas on your body that might be ticklish, you‚Äôve never been touched there by someone else and you won‚Äôt know until it happens. The headline is, don‚Äôt necessarily expect or build up the wedding night to be all fireworks and orgasms. You might find that it absolutely is that, which would be great of course, but it also might be awkward and uncomfortable and it might take a few goes before you get the real fireworks happening.

Oh lastly, if you have any intention of doing oral, shower like right beforehand.. give your penis *and* ass a thorough wash. You don‚Äôt think the ass is involved? It might not be but it‚Äôs right next door. With any luck someone will give the wife this same advice about washing. 

Anyway, this sounds all bad‚Ä¶. I dunno maybe I‚Äôm just telling you all the stuff I wish I‚Äôd been told before my first time. It‚Äôs really great though. You‚Äôre in for a treat.

Elite is still going strong, Everytime a new ace combat comes out it sells like crazy. Some people are still sucking the hopium out of Star Citizen's dead scrotum. 

The problem is more that people don't make these games. Since they're never the in Vogue game to play, developers don't realize how many people actually want to play these games. 

Elite dangerous is a case study in this. This every time fdev gets their shit together, their player base shoots right back up to Golden age levels. 

The other problem is that every game finds a niche and stays there. If you like elite, you're going to hate the flight model in NMS, if you like the on foot exploration if NMS, elite isn't going to hold a candle to it. If you like complete games that actually launch, Star Citizen will piss you off. X4's maps are restrictive, though it does hit like a cross between elite and the Golden age of Eve.

"Oh, you‚Äôre looking forward to me not responding? Cute. But since you went through all this effort, I‚Äôd hate to disappoint you.


1. Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòfascism‚Äô‚ÄîDefine it.
Claiming news organizations are ‚Äúillegal‚Äù is obviously political rhetoric, not a legal action. If rhetoric equals fascism, then let‚Äôs talk about actual government-backed censorship through social media collusion, DHS ‚Äòdisinfo‚Äô boards, and direct suppression of dissent under previous administrations. You asked for examples? Look up the Twitter Files, the Missouri v. Biden case, and how the government leaned on tech companies to silence viewpoints they disliked.

2. Mass censorship‚ÄîDo you really want to go there?
You‚Äôre pretending that speech suppression is a one-sided issue, but the overwhelming evidence shows that mass deplatforming, corporate-government coordination, and ‚Äòdisinformation‚Äô crackdowns always lean one way. If Trump did this at the same scale, you‚Äôd be screaming about dictatorship.

3. Political prosecutions‚ÄîYou need me to spell it out?
Selective prosecution, double standards in the justice system, and the use of lawfare to silence opposition are textbook authoritarian tactics. Biden‚Äôs DOJ has done more to weaponize the courts against political enemies than anything you‚Äôre alleging Trump did. Meanwhile, Trump‚Äôs actual supporters were surveilled, censored, and labeled as extremists for daring to exist.

4. Forcing ideological loyalty‚ÄîYes, DEI is a cult.
Nice baiting attempt. No one is arguing against equal opportunity‚Äîwhat‚Äôs being called out is the demand for ideological conformity, where anyone questioning the dogma of ‚Äúequity‚Äù is punished. The government forcing schools and corporations to adopt ideological frameworks under the guise of ‚Äòinclusion‚Äô is the definition of compelled speech. Scrubbing DEI initiatives that actively push racial and ideological discrimination isn‚Äôt ‚Äòerasing equality,‚Äô it‚Äôs removing state-enforced propaganda.

"It's even a little more subtle than that.

Anaesthesia is a trifecta. You remove awareness, pain, and movement.

Propofol can remove awareness, but your nerve endings (and ultimately, your central nervous system) can still register pain, even if you're not consciously aware of it. Pain is a dynamic response, and left untreated, it can grow, independant of your conscious awareness.

So in addition to propofol, you will generally be given an opioid, and a local anaesthetic, to deal with pain during the intra, and peri-operative period. Even though you're not consciously aware of the pain that's being inflicted on your body, the pain is treated while you're under the effect of propofol/sevoflurane/etc, to minimize the ""residual"" pain you experience when you wake. The pain pathways (which have pathways independent of your conscious awareness) aren't given the opportunity to kick off.",No Slang,funny

"Multiple issues with making her a mutated Witcher that make it a stretch:

1. Anyone who knew how to do it is dead past Witcher 3
2. A woman has never survived the poisoning
3. Geralt and/or Yennefer would have gone absolutely apeshit if she so much as hinted she'd like to try it
4. She's a lot older than your typical candidate
5. Her Elder blood is sure to be factor in how the poisons work
6. Ciri is already plenty special, different and important. Does her character really need another ""otherness"" hurdle to fight?

So to make it work they'd have to:

1. Invent someone/someway to know how to do it
2. That someone/someway needs to have a miraculous method that suddenly works on women, defying all previous knowledge
3. Ciri's ""parents"" need to be out of the picture for it
4. Take into account her powers, probably by inventing a way to remove them altogether (as they don't really work for a player controlled character anyway)

Not that it can't be done of course, you can write anything when it comes to fantasy, but it stretches the consistency of the unvierse quite a bit and seems rather forceful.

In terms of story, Ciri could (and would, imo) just as well try to be a witcher using her own skills and considerable magic powers. But then she wouldn't work well as a player controlled character and wouldn't conform to the Witcher series gameplay formula.

Atheist answers the question, providing sources and explaining why successful evolution in a social species requires a certain amount of social agreement to instill trust and ensure cooperation, and how a social species, especially one incapable of successfully surviving on their own like humans, would necessarily require a certain level of what we call ""a moral code"" to survive, explaining entirely how morality can exist without a god arbitrating it.

The next day, same theist, same sub:

""AThEisTs, iF nO gOd THeN hoW dOeS MoRaLitY EveN?""

No. It's rather just an exercise in ""owning the X"" where X is just a placeholder for whomever you consider your opposition. Libs. MAGATs. Atheists. Jews. Whatever flavor it happens to be. 

These questions aren't asked in good faith. They have no intent of accepting any answers, even one presented in good faith. 

It's all about ""owning the libs"" or whatever, and that's all it will ever be.

I was on a lot of codeine pre op, so my morphine tolerance was, still is, sky high. They had given me morphine before coming out and it was doing precisely fuck all.

The nurse said something along the lines of 'it's okay lovely, we'll give you the good stuff' and promptly shot me up with fentanyl

Holy fucking shit. I have never gone from such all consuming agony to blistering euphoria so quickly. The hand of God himself touched me then and removed every pain I had on this mortal plane.

"To be fair, that's always been the case to an extent. Video games started off with people in their teens and early 20s getting into programming. These same people got older and matured. They're obviously no longer 20 somethings. So, unless you found a studio only comprised of young people of that generation you will always have older people trying to come up with stories for younger audiences. That's just how it is, unless you want to have some young and inexperienced writer take over a multi-million dollar franchise with barely any supervision. But maybe some conversations with actual younger team members or normal people ... not activists ... might help. It can work. We've seen it.

Praying the surgery removed everything and he won't need long term care, we find out soon. 

Also to add, I asked for the divorce because of his infidelity, an affair that I found has spanned off and on for 6 years.

On the other hand hardware is expensive, and right now modern releases suffer awful performance and there isn't much you can do except throw money at it and hope you can brute force the problems away.   Then you have 3rd party launchers which are buggy and awful.. (looking at Uplay etc) 

If you're in two minds, honestly you won't be losing much by sticking to consoles if you're only interested in modern releases..  but if you're looking for games that you simply can't get on a console, older games or mods then a PC is the best call.

"That's fair, and with the amount of time spent I think it's okay for people to reach a point where the game isn't appealing anymore. While I'm not huge into it, I do know some Squadrons are quite enjoying the fact that Colonisation and Powerplay both open up new avenues to manipulate the background sim and push factional system control more, though outside of the meagre credit payouts that's not a huge boost to background sim elements actually rewarding the players taking part of it.

I'm personally of the opinion that Elite has locked themselves out of ship interiors as a feature though. At least one with any sort of proper gameplay benefit. With viewpoint changes all consistently requiring loading screens, power allocation and repairs all being done from the cockpit, and the general way the game is built, ship interiors in Elite would either be a cosmetic room that doesn't interface with the rest of the game, or require a huge chunk of reworking that would mess with how people set up their ships. At most it would be like X4, where it's a nice thing to have but mostly vestigal (though in X4 you can get an NPC to take over your vessel and handle flying while you sit down and play empire management).",No Slang,gaming

There were never really any stories about the development being troubled (other than the feature creep that came with changing it from a dlc to a sequel) it was just complete silence for a while.  The team is small, little things can result in big delays.  

It's also worth noting that the last proper trailer was part of the 2022 xbox e3 gamepass thing where they said ""every game shown here will release by the end of the year"" so they must have been reasonably confident it would be done that year, yet it's one of only two games shown that still isn't out.

"I'm glad you pointed this out. A lot of complaints on the game industry I see thrown at 'developers'. From microtransactions to delays to releases before being done. All those decisions are from way up in management and the publisher, not the lowly artists and developers doing the coding, modeling, testing.

Even more developer-adjacent complains like 'games are poorly optimized today and just require more powerful GPUs because developers are lazy now'. Again, its not so much developers are less skilled or lazy, its that games are more and more complex and publishers are pushing better graphics, ray tracing, more effects, bigger worlds, etc. and there's only so much resources and time to do it. The developers aren't making these decisions and if they are pushed to make it bigger, shinier, out the door faster, these are going to supercede optimized. It doesnt help that hardware these days makes less optimized graphics engines even possible, in the NES to PS2 era software techniques were generally ahead of software and it was possible to squeeze performance out of limited memory and raster, now with frame gen, upscaling, 24GB+ vram, fast SSDs, 300W cards, etc. possible, and the AAA sequel expected next year,  its like why even bother with some of the genius steps devs took in 90s and early 2000s to make magic happen with potato hardware, cartridges, physical discs, platter drives, minimal ram, slow clock speeds.",No Slang,gaming

With my impacted wisdom teeth, I was 18 and I woke up crying so bad they had to have my mom come back early and they were so mean about it. 

Emergency surgery due to a ruptured ectopic and internal bleeding is the only one I don't fully remember waking up from. But I do remember a nurse holding my hand in the OR before. I was in so much pain... he was such a rock for me. I was ready to be knocked out for that one. Did not care. Came to terms with the fact that I might die. 

With my gallbladder, I remember coming out of it upset and hearing someone say ""go get her doctor so she recognizes someone."" And the doctor came and stroked my hand and explained it went well. My response? ""You're so young!"" Lmao meanwhile the guy next to me is asking when he can eat. So chill.

Then it happened again in 2023 for another abdominal surgery. I remember hearing the nurse bring my husband in and tell him something like ""she just started calming down."" And I started groaning and crying again and he had a giggle. He said the noises were... interesting hahah.

"Because Tesla's autopilot is a gimmick. They call it autopilot yet it's a glorified helper. It won't drive the car by itself, ever. With cameras it's impossible because it won't drive in rain or fog which is conditions found in most nations. And back in 2014 even with lidar you wouldn't really get anywhere. We are over a decade later and the autopilot Elon promised every year is nowhere to be seen.

But today it's getting possible. Back then Elon was sorta correct, it was overkill. The idea was to put lidar in all cars and then keep updating the car until it was self-driving. But that's $15K extra a car for something that does absolutely nothing yet. It was easier to call it totally useless and a waste.

Unfortunately even the people marketing it are underselling it as they are not Elon. It can see round corners which humans can't. So it can see cars that are incoming. And it looks past fog and rain. For these cars prediction is everything and you have corners in all cities. Lidar will drive way better than humans. Cameras will never see past corners.",No Slang,OutOfTheLoop

"I haven't looked into it in awhile, but it used to be cost as the major reason (LIDAR would be over 10k to add to a car); however, supposedly that cost has dropped dramatically to about $500 to $1000 per car. The best and safest self-driving solution would absolutely use both, but I'm not aware of a car that does that yet.

It's not impossible that Tesla could change its mind and add LIDAR if it isn't so cost-prohibitive now.

I think Comma AI makes a product that can leverage a car's LIDAR sensors and combine it with its own camera-based self-driving technology, but I'm not 100% sure on that.",No Slang,OutOfTheLoop

4.  \*What if I fail to make it enjoyable for her?\*   

  You won't. It sounds like she loves you and yearns for you like you do for her. You might not make her come, she might not make you come, you might not be able to get hard or stay hard. It's all natural. You're still going to enjoy it because you're spending time together with someone you love, and not only that you're doing something very intimate, fun and loving. It will be enjoyable. It will also be awkward, painful (you always end up doing something like stubbing your toe and to be honest it can hurt a bit to enter a woman even if you've been going at it), stressful, uncomfortable, and all the positive words I've already used. It's going to be a lot. It's also, probably, going to be about 5 minutes or so if we go by the median. I would recommend you don't think of seggs as something with a clear start and stop - The typical ""Pen in pal is when sex"" mentality - but instead consider it something more gradual. This will help make the whole experience much more enjoyable, because you will be focused on the whole, not just one of its' parts. Flirting, sweet-talking, kissing, heavy petting, touching, caressing, fondling, hand-stuff, mouth-stuff, penetrating, more mouth stuff, more penetrating, coming, more hand-stuff, some caressing, kissing, a break, a bit of grinding, more penetrating, just holding each other, realising you're both really tired and you're not in the mood for athletics, lying down while still being inside her, holding each other tight, cuddling, etc.  



It's not an act with a clearly defined start and stop. Just because one part of the act doesn't occur or doesn't go well does not mean the act itself was not enjoyable.",No Slang,NoStupidQuestions

"In case you don't get it, a depression on the road is a dip where the pavement is slightly lower than the rest of the pavement. They occasionally fill with rainwater.

The joke refers to a different kind of depression: MDD. It is a serious mood disorder that is sometimes misunderstood as sadness and feeling down all the time. The reality is, depression is a mental illness rather than an emotion. It often comes with appetite changes, sleep changes, loss of interest in once enjoyed activities, etc.",No Slang,funny

Evidently they felt that A Way Out was successful enough for their indie initiative that they have continued on with It Takes Two and Split Fiction.

So yes, great for the industry that EA gave Fares a chance and didn't throw a fit at that free friend pass and its theoretical impact on their bottom line.",No Slang,gaming
